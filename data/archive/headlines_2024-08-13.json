        "story_text":"Pyongyang, December 24 (KCNA) -- Japan continues discharging nuclear-contaminated water into sea, endangering the lives and security of all mankind.\nThe Japanese authorities recently announced its plan to begin the fourth-round discharge of nuclear-polluted water into sea next February.\nThe point is that they decided not to confirm the amount of tritium in the water this time though such process had been gone through for the mere form's sake.\nJapan, which finally started the discharge of nuclear-polluted water in disregard of serious concern and uneasiness of the international community, hyping it as \"clean and treated water\", is going to release the water into sea without going through the process of identifying the amount of radioactive materials. This is just an unpardonable rash behavior of making a mockery of human life.\nThe world public still remembers the unheard-of terrible crimes Japan committed during the Second World War by organizing secret germ-warfare units like Unit 731 and Unit 516 to frantically speed up the research and production of various bio-chemical weapons and reducing Koreans and other Asian people to guinea pigs for confirming their feasibility.\nToday the descendants of the germ-warfare criminals ill-famed for inflicting untold pain and misfortune upon regional people are exposing the life and security of all mankind on Earth to serious danger by contaminating the sea, common wealth of mankind, with radioactive water.\nNo wonder, huge piles of dead sardines washed ashore in Japan in October and in December became a hot topic of world media.\nCommenting on such worrisome phenomena, foreign media described the scene as \"fish waves.\"\nRecalling that the phenomena happened three months after the discharge of radioactive water into sea off Fukushima, Daily Mail reported that this casts the suspicion that Japan's discharge of nuclear-polluted water affected the ecological system.\nAgainst this backdrop, there is a widespread public opinion in China believing that sardines were killed by nuclear contamination and deploring that Japan's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water will soon exterminate mankind.\nBut Japan has gone so far as to say \"there is no problem in safety\", impudently citing \"tolerable limit.\"\nThere is no smoke without fire.\nJapan's discharge of nuclear-polluted water is not the one merely concerning some countries and region but a high-profile hideous crime that seriously threatens all countries and regions in the world and even the distant future of mankind.\nJapan, defying the unanimous voice of the international community and mocking human life, can never evade its responsibility for the heinous crime. -0-",

And in February the following year, it seized another tanker in the waters off the United Arab Emirates, asserting that the ship is related to the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps of Iran, and plundered about 2 million barrels of oil and sold it for 110 million U.S. dollars.\nAs regards the recent capture of the U.S. oil tanker, Iran said that its action is a part of the retaliation against the U.S. oil-plundering act, declaring that \"the days when the U.S. stole oil and ran away has gone and we will not allow the U.S. to threaten our country in the region.\"\nIt is a deserved punishment for the U.S., the kingpin of modern-day \"pirate\" who does not hesitate to commit such heinous crimes as seizing other country's resources in broad daylight, not content with fattening through aggression and plunder.\nThe \"piracy\" by the U.S. is not confined to Iran only.\nAfter being stationed in Syria in a conspiratorial and brigandish way, the U.S. has stretched its tentacles of robbery not only to oil but also to grain, cotton and other agricultural products.\nEarly in January 2023, it plundered oil and wheat by mobilizing 60 tankers and trucks, and in December alone, stole a large amount of oil and food twice from Syria which suffered from earthquake damage.\nThe U.S., engrossed in plundering and robbery in different parts of the world, has disgraced itself from the outset of the year.\nIt is quite natural that the despicable plunder by the gangster-like U.S. is punished by justice. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The following is the KCNA commentary titled \"Fascist violence that insulted the Korean victims of forcible drafting in denial of past crimes\":\nShortly ago, the Gunma prefectural authorities of Japan committed such fascist violence as forcibly removing a memorial monument to the Korean victims of forcible drafting.\nThe monument, erected in the Gunma Prefectural Park in April 2004 in the hope that Japanese would always remember and repent of the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the past and promote peace in Asia and friendship between the DPRK and Japan, has been a symbol of the lessons of history for nearly 20 years.\nHowever, the prefectural authorities turned down the renewal of the licence for the monument and decided on its removal, terming the phrase \"forcible drafting,\" mentioned at the memorial service held in front of the monument in 2012, \"loss of political neutrality\" and \"act running counter to its establishment purpose\".\nThe Gunma prefectural authorities had been impossible to attain their goal due to the fierce protests by the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and Japanese civic and social circles. This year they finally removed the monument in such a forcible way as \"administrative execution\".\nThis is a base act of denying the past crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists, who inflicted untold pain and misfortune upon Korea and many other countries and nations in Asia, and beautifying their colonial rule over them. It is an unpardonable unethical act of reopening the old wounds among the direct victims of forcible drafting and their descendants.\nJapan can never cover up the forcible drafting and forced labor it committed against the Korean people in the last century.\nIn order to forcibly mobilize human and material resources needed for the war of aggression on April 1, 1938, the Japanese imperialists promulgated the \"National Mobilization Law\" containing the gangster-like paragraph - \"the enactment of the current law applies to external territories (colonies).\" They also instituted or revised such evil laws as \"Ordinance on Labor Conscription\" and \"the Women's Volunteer Corps Service Ordinance\", thus forcibly drafting and abducting the Korean people into the sites of death, irrespective of their age and sex.\nThousands of forcibly drafted Korean people were forced into slave labor at munitions factories, underground factories, airports, power stations and mines in Gunma Prefecture alone.  Many Koreans lost their lives in the alien land at the end of their harsh labor and miserable life.\nIt is the legal duty and due obligation of the assailant nation to feel sorry for the victims, make reparation for the crimes and prevent the recurrence of such misfortune.\nBut the Gunma prefectural authorities revealed their anti-historical and unethical true colors and wild revanchist ambition through the unreasonable and forcible removal of the memorial monument to the Korean victims of forcible drafting.\nWhat merits a more serious attention is that the Gunma prefectural governor who led and directed the removal is a die-hard ultra-right politician steeped in hostility toward the DPRK to the marrow of his bones, and is in cahoots with the behind-the-scene forces working hard to remove the monument to the Korean victims of the great Kanto quake in Tokyo and other similar monuments across the Japanese archipelago.\nTo write off the past history is meant to repeat it.\nChongryon, Koreans in Japan and Japanese political parties and social organizations are now waging a dynamic struggle demanding the restoration of the monument, resolutely denouncing the unreasonable violence.\nThe Gunma prefectural authorities should ponder over the consequences to be entailed by the present situation which sparked off great anger at home and abroad and restore the memorial monument at once.\nThey can never evade the responsibility for the fascist violence. -0-",

Therefore, it is just as expected.\nThe foolish \"human rights\" conspiratorial racket, which has nothing to do with ensuring genuine human rights, will not work on the DPRK.\nBut there is a need to take this opportunity.\nThe most urgent issue facing the international community in the field of human rights is the protection of the rights to existence of inhabitants in the Gaza Strip exposed to mass killings.\nSince the armed clash between the Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine (Hamas) and Israel broke out in October last year, tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians have been killed and one million and hundreds of thousand of refugees in Rafah City, the southern city of Gaza, are exposed to death threats.\nIn particular, many Palestinian children have been killed or have become orphans and disabled. Even elementary right to existence is violated, far from the right to education and healthcare. This miserable reality arouses serious concern of the international community.\nEven politicians of the Western countries, pro-U.S. and pro-Israeli ones, admit that human casualties and humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip have already reached an \"intolerable\" phase, urging an urgent investigation into whether Israel has observed international law on human rights and relevant treaties.\nHowever, the U.S., often taking issue with the \"human rights situation\" of other countries and styling itself \"human rights judge\", is keeping mum about it.\nThe world is watching once again the shameless behavior of the U.S., asking why the \"human rights champion\", which used to cry out for adopting human rights resolutions, imposing sanctions on some countries with faked-up data and referring the issue to the International Court of Justice, is keeping mum about the thrice-cursed human rights abuses committed by Israel.\nWhere does the United States focus its attention?\nThere is no more obvious answer than the fact.\nThe U.S. is seeking to divert the attention of the international community by orchestrating the visit by its \"special envoy for human rights\", while feigning ignorance about the terrible human rights situation in the Gaza Strip. This clearly proves that the attention of the \"human rights judge\" is not focused on the protection of genuine human rights.\nThe U.S. seeks to tarnish the image of the anti-imperialist independent countries, which are opposed to its high-handed and arbitrary practices, under the pretext of \"human rights issue\", alienate their governments from people and finally overthrow their social systems.\nThe alternative and double-dealing American-style \"human rights\" are the means for implementing the hegemonic policy and for aggression and interference in internal affairs as such standards and countermeasures change according to whether the targets are pro-U.S. or anti-U.S.\nThe present reality, in which human rights cannot be protected if the sovereignty of the state is violated, clearly proves that the DPRK's claim - human rights precisely means the sovereignty - is entirely just.\nIf the DPRK had not defended the sovereignty of the state and firmly bolstered up its capabilities for self-defence, it would have suffered the same misfortune as the Palestinians.\nHuman rights not guaranteed by the sovereignty and strength of the state are just like building a castle on the sand. If the sovereignty is weak and the sovereignty is not defended, it is impossible to guarantee elementary right to existence, to say nothing of the dignity and development of individuals. This is a bitter lesson taught by the present world.\nWe will resolutely foil the U.S. and riff-raffs' \"human rights\" racket, regarding it as a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and the most grave challenge to its existence and development, and defend the inviolable sovereignty and genuine human rights in the future, too.\nThe special envoy for \"human rights\", engrossed in the \"human rights smear campaign against the DPRK\", had better visit the Middle East, if he or she is not a political maid of the White House but a true \"human rights champion.\" Then the envoy may get \"actual results.\" -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- The UN Security Council on Feb. 20 put a resolution reflecting the world public opinion to resolutely check Israel's massacre of Palestinians to a vote, but only the U.S. exercised the veto to make the vote finally end in a failure.\nThis brought to light the hypocritical behavior of the U.S. which has gone so shameless as to stage a double-dealing farce after driving the Middle East region to the vortex of horrible war. And it sparked off bitterer curse and denunciation of the international community.\nFrom the outset of the year the U.S. secretary of State made a busy tour of Middle East countries to try to gain attention as if he was interested in peace, saying that it is necessary to prevent the vicious cycle of violence and protect civilians. And even Biden let loose a string of rhetoric about the \"ceasefire\", stunning the world people.\nShortly ago, the White House announced that Biden held a phone conversation with the Israeli prime minister and called for taking \"immediate and detailed measures\" to expand the thorough and sustained humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip.\nThe U.S. is behaving like a faithful \"apostle of peace\". One reason of such behavior is to clam down the international community's anger at Israel's massacre of Palestinian civilians. But it is nothing but a trick to relieve itself of the concern about the possibility of getting totally isolated and rejected due to its pro-Israel one-sided policy.\nThe U.S., from a historical point of view, has zealously shielded and encouraged the Zionists' moves for territorial expansion, regarding Israel as a shock brigade in realizing its strategy for dominating Middle East and has put them forward as its stooges to increase the regional chaos and instability.\nAfter the conflict in the Gaza Strip in October last year, the U.S. offered Israel a huge amount of various lethal weapons, claiming that Israel should be fully prepared for self-defense. It also collected sensitive information about the leadership of the Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine (Hamas) and the Gaza Strip and offered it to Israel.\nIsrael clearly said that all its missiles, ammunition, precision guided bombs, planes and bombs are provided by the U.S. and without the U.S., it can never fight this war. Like this, the U.S. is behind the bloody disaster in the Gaza Strip.\nDespite the growing voices of the international community calling for realizing the ceasefire and putting an end to the war, the U.S. has steadily supported Israel's massacre politically and militarily, contrary to its massive propaganda about its \"effort for ceasefire\".\nSome days ago, the U.S. Senate passed a bill on aid of more than 14 billion U.S. dollars to Israel. And the U.S. refused for a third time the resolution on the enforcement of ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, which was recently brought up to the UN Security Council.\nAfter all, the U.S. again suppressed the international community's demand for defusing humanitarian crisis and putting an end to war, thus bringing to light its true colors as a vicious harasser of Middle East peace and a rare murderer before the world people.\nAll the facts clearly prove that the \"efforts for ceasefire\" touted by the U.S. are nothing but \"crocodile's tears\" full of hypocrisy and deception.\nWith nothing can the U.S. cover up its moves to block the peaceful settlement of the crisis and keep inciting Israel to bloodshed. And it can never evade the blame for having plunged the Middle East into bloody massacre and extreme confusion. -0-",

The point is that the international order pursued by the U.S. is grounded in the law of the jungle, \"the logic of power\".\nIt's pretty regrettable that the chief diplomat of a \"superpower\" let out such shameful, nasty remarks at the venue of the international conference dealing with global security issues.\nHowever, it is \"helpful\" that his bullshit once again made the world keenly realize that the \"rules-based international order\" trumpeted by the U.S. is a \"jungle law\" where the strong prey on the weak.\nCommenting on this, the Russian foreign minister said that \"the U.S. is coercing other countries into sharing its 'international system table', or else they will be on the 'menu'\". The Chinese newspaper Global Times reported that \"Washington's current official diplomatic rhetoric emphasizes the so-called 'rules-based international order,' but it is all used as tools to demand, restrain, and accuse others, or to cover up U.S. own hegemonic intentions\".\nAs recognized by public at home and abroad, it is the U.S. that cannot survive without preying on the weak, in view of its origination and existence mode.\nBuilt on the sea of blood of Indians, the U.S. staged over 114 big and small wars of aggression and more than 8 900 military interference actions for over 130 years until World War I, and expanded its territory by over ten times by annexing and subordinating other countries and nations.\nAfter World War II, the U.S. has grown corpulent through many wars and military interference actions in the DPRK, Vietnam, Iraq, Syria and other parts of the world and maintained its privileged position.\nEven in the present century when the unipolar world has been collapsing and a new, multi-polarized international order is being established, the U.S. is persistently pursuing its hegemonic and aggressive mode of existence and foreign policy, being obsessed with \"overconfidence in its own strength\", and is constantly breaking the security and stability of the world.\nThe present Middle East situation which has no sign of solution and goes bad to worse can be explained only by the logic of the animal instinct of the U.S.\nThe New York Times in an article titled \"Understanding the Middle East through the Animal Kingdom\" likened the U.S. going to become the \"king of the Middle East jungle\" to a lion and the Middle East countries to a \"parasitoid wasp\" or \"caterpillars\", and stressed the need for the U.S. to burn the whole jungle to kill the parasitoid wasp.\nHence, clearly proved are the true colors of the U.S. sacrificing the Middle East countries and the whole region for its ambition for domination.\nIn a nutshell, the U.S. is devouring others at the table, some countries and nations in the Middle East including Palestine are on the menu as the \"fish and meat\" and Israel is \"skillfully cooking\" to suit the taste of the U.S.\nThe outlook on the world based on the American-style jungle law and hegemonic foreign policy of the U.S. justifying aggression and war for existence can never be tolerated in the present era of human civilization.\nThe U.S. should no longer be allowed to devour the world at the table. -0-",

This sparked off more criticism and vigilance from the international community.\nAgainst this backdrop, the departed souls of the shrine, which have overheated the Japanese politicians with reinvasion fever, came to play the role of a \"mental education master\" for those responsible for realizing the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" under the command of the former SDF high-ranking officer.\nNamely, it is the reality of Japan that the departed souls of the \"imperial army\", who embarked on the road of aggression and plunder in the last century, are openly \"revived\" by the SDF contaminated by militarist poison - the modern-day \"imperial army\u201d.\nNo matter how hard Japan tries to defend such visits to the shrine calling them \"private visits made of their own free will\" under an avalanche of international protests and accusations, it can never cover up the true purpose of the visit to the shrine aimed at militarizing itself and realizing its revanchist ambition.\nWhether it is \"individual freedom\" or \"private visit\", their appearing at the shrine is an undisguised glorification of the unethical crimes committed by Japan and, moreover, danger is mounting as the reinvasion fanatics of the SDF are taking the lead in fanning up ultra-nationalism in Japanese society.\nJapan is ceaselessly expanding the SDF into an offensive force equipped with ultra-modern military hardware while embellishing its past crimes through the distortion of history and trumpeting about the alleged \"growing threat\" from neighboring countries.\nIt is the ambition of Japan for reinvasion that remains unchanged no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and it is self-evident that mankind will suffer another great calamity when it is overlooked.\nWhoever loves peace should be vigilant against the departed souls of the \"imperial army\" that are \"reviving\" in the dark corner of the shrine. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- Kang Jin Song, an international affairs analyst of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued the following article titled \"What is Washington's scheme to extend the sphere of alliance aimed at\":\nThe U.S. is now intensifying its scheme to expand and strengthen military blocs in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAs known, the U.S.-Britain-Australia tripartite defense authority talks on April 8 made public a joint statement on examining a proposal for promoting cooperation between AUKUS and Japan in the field of ultra-modern technology. And Biden confirmed Japan's participation in AUKUS at the U.S.-Japan summit held in Washington on April 10.\nIt means that the extension of AUKUS and the preferential participation of Japan have become formal.\nThe U.S. defends itself saying that cooperation between AUKUS and Japan is limited to the field related to eight core defense technologies, including artificial intelligence and cyber, and it's not aimed at increasing the number of AUKUS members, but the danger of Japan's participation in AUKUS is making the whole international community tense, not to mention the regional countries.\nIn September 2021, AUKUS was forged as a tripartite security cooperation body involving the United States, Britain and Australia. Since its founding, it has been called a nuclear mine planted in the waters of the Asia-Pacific as \"the Anglo-Saxon nuclear submarine alliance\" for seeking nuclear supremacy in the Asia-Pacific region by detouring the international nuclear non-proliferation system.\nJudging from the fact that the extension of AUKUS has become formal and the first candidate for its membership is Japan, a state of aggression and war criminal which tried to develop nuclear weapons during the Second World War and has covertly beefed up its capability for manufacturing nuclear weapons after the war, this poses a serious problem in terms of security environment of the whole world including the Asia-Pacific region.\nWhen the issue of extending AUKUS appeared on the table, Britain and Australia reportedly took a skeptical view, pointing out that Japan failed to fully protect sensitive information.\nAlthough Canada and New Zealand, members of \"Five Eyes\" - an information-sharing body of Anglo-Saxons - were potential candidates for \"AUKUS+\", Japan has been designated as a candidate member of AUKUS, which is attributable to the U.S. pressure and persistent persuasion, according to experts.\nClear is the intention of the U.S. that persists in involving Japan in AUKUS.\nIt is the sinister intention of the U.S. to make Japan, a vanquished country which revised the \"Pacifist Constitution\" and is making frantic moves to beef up the forces of aggression under the cloak of \"possessing counterattack capability\", obsessed by nationalism, a crewmember of a confrontation ship called AUKUS and put it at the outpost line of the anti-China pressure and push the nuclear minefield in the Asia-Pacific region closer to China.\nMost experts comment that the technical cooperation between AUKUS and Japan, promoted under the control of the U.S., will lead sooner or later to its full membership and to the additional admission of other potential candidate countries.\nThe Biden administration recently held a tripartite summit of the U.S., Japan and the Philippines in the wake of a U.S.-Japan summit to call for the strengthened security cooperation between Manila and Tokyo, and Canberra and Seoul. This is mainly aimed at building double and triple infrastructure for implementing the \"integrated deterrence strategy\" against China by ultimately putting together tools designed for achieving supremacy existing in the Asia-Pacific region in a \"latticed\" way.\nThe reality goes to prove once again that the \"competition accompanied by dialogue\" with China and the \"installation of a guard rail\" in bilateral relations, heard from U.S. public officials, are nothing but deceptive slogans and their thinking and practice are oriented to anti-China confrontation from A to Z.\nOwing to the establishment of a \"small group\" of the U.S. whose arch enemy is China and its ceaseless attempt to expand the group, the Asia-Pacific region, where opportunities and potentials for development are richer than any other region of the world, is turning into a theatre of muscle-flexing and a touch-and-go nuclear minefield, and the ensuing immediate and prospective security burden has been heavily placed on the regional and international community.\nThe peace camp in the region and the rest of the world should heighten vigilance against the reckless moves of Washington to frantically expand its alliance sphere without limits, targeting a certain state. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- Days ago, Prime Minister of Japan Kishida said at a meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives that \"he remains unchanged in his intention to revise the Constitution and that he would go on to make every effort to advance.\"\nIt goes without saying that the real aim sought by Japan in its desperate moves for revising the Constitution is to turn it into a \"country capable of fighting a war\" by revising the \"Pacifist Constitution\" for the worse.\nArticle 9 of the Constitution of Japan enforced since 1947 stipulates that Japan will give up for ever the war started by its state power and the threat of armed forces or the use of armed forces as a means for settling international disputes.\nThe former chief of the Legislation Bureau of the Japanese Cabinet said:\nArticle 9 stipulates that Japan will have no ground, naval and air forces and other war capabilities. In other words, Japan will possess self-defence force not an army.\nThere are two pillars that support the concept of \"self-defence\". One is that the Japan Self-Defence Forces can protect only their own country and not use armed forces abroad. Another one is the \"exclusive defense\" whose important aspect is that the SDF cannot have offensive weapons and it cannot have the capability to directly attack other countries' territories and territorial waters and airspace.\nIn this regard, it can be said that the Constitution has constrained to some extent the revival of Japanese militarism which had inflicted great damage on the peoples of Asian countries, advocating the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\"\nBut today, after a lapse of 77 years since the enforcement of the Constitution, Japan has completely removed the mask of \"peace\" which it had worn for form's sake.\nThe prime minister, referring to the existence of SDF set up as the revising item of the Constitution, stressed that \"it is an important work for showing the international community the will to defend the self-sustenance of the state and peace by putting an end to the theory of the SDF's violating of the Constitution, and making the members of the SDF fulfill their duties with pride\", and thus openly revealed where the purpose of the revision is.\nAs a matter of fact, the Japanese reactionaries have put spurs to turning Japan into a military giant after their defeat in the World War II behind the curtain of \"peace\" such as the \"Pacifist Constitution\", \"era of peace\", \"peaceful development\", \"proactive pacifism\" and \"achieving peace\".\nWith the revision of the \"Japan-U.S. Defence Cooperation Guidelines\" and the adoption of the \"security legislation\", they made it possible to expand the sphere of the SDF's activities, confined to Japan's vicinity, to the whole world and to exercise the \"right to collective self-defence\" under the pretext of military support to its allies.\nThe present Cabinet again revised the national security strategy, set by the Abe regime in 2013. It has approved the \"securing of the capability of attacking enemy base\" and is stepping up the preparation of long-range cruise missiles capable of directly attacking other countries' territories.\nAccording to the 2019-2023 trends in international arms transfers released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden on March 11, Japan purchased 29 fighters from the U.S. and ordered 400 long-range missiles for \"enemy base attack\", thus increasing its import of weapons by 155 percent over that in 2014-2018 to become the world's sixth-ranked importer of weapons.\nThe Japanese government included in the 2024 budget the defence fund, which is 16.9 percent increase over the last year to reach the highest record in history, and formally passed it on March 28.\nAlso, after discarding the principle of banning the export of lethal weapons, the Cabinet meeting decided to allow the export of fighters to the third country.\nIn the final analysis, \"the exclusive defense using defence capability only under attack, the abandonment of the possession of capability of attacking enemy base that means direct attack on other countries' territories, the principle of banning the export of weapons and the maintenance of defence capability that basically constrains defence costs to 1% of GDP\", touted by Japan in the past, have become a lip service.\nAgainst such a background, the Japanese prime minister is crying out for the revision of the Constitution. This is aimed at legalizing the militarization moves for reinvasion ambition in an institutional way by removing even such article of the Constitution which had remained an empty document.\nJapan, which suffered a bitter defeat while pursuing the militarist policy of overseas expansion, is rushing to turn itself into a militarist country and launch overseas expansion, oblivious of it. This is a foolish and reckless behavior of digging its own grave. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- Following is the full text of an article \"Provocation to regional peace and security can never be tolerated\" issued by a military commentator of the DPRK on Friday:\nOn May 16, the U.S. military sent F-22 stealth fighters deployed in Hawaii to the Korean peninsula and staged a \"simulated air battle\" with the Republic of Korea (ROK) for the first time.\nTwo F-22 stealth fighters of the U.S. air force and two F-35A stealth fighters of the ROK air force, involved in the drill, exchanged the roles of attack and defence with each other. The enemy media claim that the drill demonstrated the powerful \"deterrent\" to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\nWithout any explanation, we are well aware of why stealth fighters boasting of the \"world's strongest\" have been introduced.\nThe \"revisit\" of F-22 stealth fighters to the Korean peninsula only after seven months and their first \"simulated air battle\" are another clear proof of the hostile nature of the U.S. which has persistently encroached upon regional countries' rights to security while seeking the showdown of force with the DPRK.\nThe military gangsters of the ROK are now driving the military tension on the Korean peninsula into the extremity, keeping pace with their master's anti-DPRK confrontation scheme.\nIn May alone, the ROK staged the largest-ever drill, allegedly to cope with the DPRK's \"air infiltration\", by mobilizing the ground, naval and air forces, along with \"2024 simultaneous joint drill of military corps\" and \"joint drill for defending islands in the first half of the year\" near the border of the DPRK.\nIt also plans to stage a large-scale air drill involving more than 60 fighters such as F-35A and F-15K from May 17 to 24 and have a talk of special operation commanders with the U.S. at the end of this month so as to discuss \"beheading operation\".\nAll the facts remind us once again that the strengthened military alliance and deployment of strategic assets by the U.S. are the main root of further escalating the military tension and unpredictability in the region.\nThe deployment of F-22 will only precipitate the advent of a situation that the U.S. does not want to see, rather than its military effect.\nThe more frequent \"visit\" by unbidden guest across the ocean will further promote the epochal occasions that help step up the war readiness of the DPRK and, the accumulation of such occasions will be turned into a new strategic phase that the U.S. is afraid of and has to be frightened.\nIt will not be a wise behavior to neglect the bolstering of the force capable of neutralizing the military effect of the U.S. deployment of strategic assets and annihilating the source of provocation and the commanding forces in possible case of emergency, though it is hard to completely contain such deployment, to be continued in the future.\nThe military provocations of the U.S. and the ROK against the DPRK will never escape frustration due to the powerful practical counteraction of the DPRK for defending the national security and regional peace. -0-",

They have nothing to do with the genuine international efforts for the eradication of terrorism.\nIt is a universal truth that intensified \"anti-terrorist efforts\" of the U.S. give rise to the emergence of various terrorist groups and escalated vicious cycle of terrorist attacks and retaliation, far from defusing the danger of terrorism in different parts of the world.\nThat's why the U.S. slogan of \"anti-terrorism\" is now being slandered and rejected by the international community and used internationally as an official term for characterizing Washington's aggressive foreign policy.\nThe U.S. would be well advised to work hard to stop its junior ally in the Middle East in its reckless state-sponsored terrorism, rather than wasting its energy in its foolish act of branding other countries as \"terrorist states\" under the pretext of the \"efforts against terrorism\".\nIt is the consistent stand of the DPRK to resolutely oppose all forms of terrorism threatening international peace and stability.\nBut we remind the U.S. once again that we have neither intention nor interest in cooperation with the U.S. in its \"efforts against terrorism\" exclusively used as a tool for interference and aggression on other sovereign states.\nThe DPRK will continue taking necessary measures to disclose before the international community such interference and acts of aggression openly committed by the U.S. under the signboard of \"cooperation in combating terrorism\" and to thoroughly foil them. -0-",

It has frequently put into operation the \"Nuclear Consultative Group\" plotting to use nuclear weapons against the DPRK and is planning to stage actual nuclear operation exercises with the ROK in August.\nWhat should never be overlooked is the U.S. recent sub-critical nuclear test's impact on the military security situation of the Korean peninsula as it has added new tension to the military showdown among nuclear weapons states, fomenting the international nuclear arms race.\nTo cope with the strategic instability in the region and the rest of the world caused by the U.S. unilateral action, the DPRK cannot but reconsider the measures necessary for the improvement of the overall nuclear deterrence posture within the range of its vested sovereign right and possible options.\nThe DPRK will not tolerate the creation of strategic imbalance and security vacuum in the Korean peninsula, but firmly defend its security, rights and interests through powerful deterrent action against the evolving nuclear threat from the U.S. -0-",

Furthermore, regional peace and stability are exposed to serious threats due to the U.S. and its vassal countries' ceaseless war drills for aggression.

Therefore, it has neither justification nor authority to say this or that on the issue of the exercise of the legitimate right of a sovereign state.\nFor the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the launch of a military reconnaissance satellite is an inevitable undertaking for bolstering up the might of self-defence, and what is more, it is a matter directly related with its destiny whether to defend its independent right or not. And for the international community, it is a fundamental issue whether the spirit of sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs stipulated in the UN Charter is preserved or not.\nThe unfair behavior of the UNSC which left indelible stain on the trust and reputation of the UN organization will inevitably invite a tragic result of its own collapse.\nWe will never tolerate any moves of the hostile forces to violate the inviolable sphere under the exercise of sovereignty nor step back from having access to the space reconnaissance capability which should be done surely no matter what others may say. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- Kim Yo Jong, vice department director of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, issued the following press statement on Sunday.\nThe ROK connived at the provocative act of scattering the political agitation rubbish across the border of the DPRK again on June 6 and 7 despite our repeated warning against the intemperate psychological warfare of the scum who defected from the DPRK, thus aggravating the situation.\nIn the period between June 6 and 8, the despicable political agitation rubbish was discovered in Singye and Thosan counties of North Hwanghae Province, Jangphung County and Phanmun District of Kaesong Municipality, Kosan, Phyonggang and Cholwon counties of Kangwon Province and other areas of the DPRK near the border.\nAs already warned, the DPRK scattered 7.5 tons of waste paper with more than 1 400 balloons over the border of the ROK from the night of June 8 to the dawn of June 9.\nAs you will see, we have only scattered empty waste paper without any political agitation.\nIt is quite different from the provocative political agitation rubbish scattered by the scum of the ROK against the DPRK.\nOur minimum reaction is only the just and reflective reaction at the very low level.\nOur reaction was scheduled to end on June 9, but the situation has changed.\nThe reason was explained by the act of the ROK.\nThe loudspeaker broadcasting provocation started in the border area at last.\nThis is a prelude to a very dangerous situation.\nPoliticians of Seoul are trying hard to justify their stand with the only and strange deformed logic in the world that regulates and judges the \"freedom of expression\" and \"provocation\" in the windward direction. And they formalized their behavior just like a guilty filing the suit first that they have resumed the loudspeaker broadcasting smear campaign again against the DPRK's counteraction against their challengeable act, thus creating a new crisis.\nWe strongly denounce the despicable and childish behavior of the ROK and clarify our stand responding to it.\nIf the ROK simultaneously carries out the leaflet scattering and loudspeaker broadcasting provocation over the border, it will undoubtedly witness the new counteraction of the DPRK.\nThe ROK will suffer a bitter embarrassment of picking up waste paper without rest and it will be its daily work.\nI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once the dangerous act of bringing the further confrontation crisis and discipline itself. -0-",

The army dropped GBU-39, a GPS guided bomb, offered by the U.S.\nOn May 26, Israel dropped the same bomb on a refugee camp in Rafah, killing more than 40 civilians.\nThe whole world is vehemently censuring Israel for its massacre in disregard of international law and humanitarian principle.\nBut this time, too, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State patronized the horrible massacre, claiming that Israel did not cross the \"red line\" set by the U.S.\nAccording to his words, the \"red line\" set by Washington in connection with Israel's military operations means a \"large-scale operation in Rafah\" and it is the U.S. stand that it has not yet seen such large-scale operation.\nHis words mean that the death toll of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip that has reached nearly 40 000 is not enough for the U.S. and Israel but scarce.\nThey are the reckless remarks that can be made by only rare murderers who regard massacre as a common practice and pleasure. They revealed who is a backer for Israel running amuck in disregard of the strong denunciation by the international society and that the \"threat\" and \"warning\" against Israel touted by the U.S. before the world are no more than hypocritical sophism.\nWorld media say that the U.S. seems to make \"diplomatic efforts\" but is positively patronizing Israel's actions and driving the situation into a more dangerous phase by switching the \"blue light\" for the tragedy lasting in the Gaza Strip.\nEven at this moment, Israel's massacre is growing in the Gaza Strip under the patronage of the U.S.\nOn June 8, 274 Palestinians were mercilessly killed and nearly 700 wounded by the Israel's military attack on the mid Gaza Strip, but the U.S. \"red line\" and its rulers remain unchanged.\nThe reality goes to clearly prove that the \"red line\" set by the U.S. is not a \"check line\" for defending the international justice and humanitarianism but a \"banister\" for its stooges and murderers.\nThe world is spitting at the disgusting entity called the U.S., the chieftain of aggression and massacre which is only committing all sorts of vicious acts while styling itself the \"guardian of international order\" and \"apostle of justice and peace\". -0-",

This is a revelation of their extreme hostility towards the other party and an expression of their sinister intention to maintain the anti-Russia alliance on the basis of it.\nSuch gathering can never be a meeting for dialogue and peace and, evidently, it will be no more than a farce for confrontation and war expansion deceiving the world.\nRussia has already disclosed that the purpose of the Swiss conference is not to discuss the ways for settling the Ukrainian situation but to work out and present an unpardonable ultimatum to it. And it declared that it has no intention to take part in any event aimed at isolating and stifling itself rather than peace, strongly demanding that the agenda item be set right.\nMany countries have refused to attend this conference, claiming that all peace proposals should be discussed on a fair basis, under the condition that Russia and Ukraine recognize and each side takes part on an equal footing.\nEven media of the host country described the \"peace summit\" as a \"merrymaking of Western partners\", commenting that the conference would meet a miserable end as it does not take account of the position of the BRICS and other countries.\nIn the final analysis, the confab, prepared by the Zelenskiy puppet clique under the manipulation of the master with much effort, will bring together only groomsmen with \"bigoted fixed assets\" of NATO in the main that have not yet got rid of the yoke of \"military assistance for Ukraine\" at the U.S. beck and call. And it will show up the disgraceful looks of admitting their diplomatic failure and \"consoling\" themselves.\nIt is quite natural that the conspiratorial conference of those keen on inciting confrontation and war under the pretext of \"peace\" has come under criticism by the international community.\nThe U.S. and the West are now resorting to the formation of an international anti-Russia confrontation front together with military support to the Zelenskiy puppet clique in a bid to turn the Ukrainian war situation at any cost. But this is a self-destruction act of pricking their own eyes with their own hands and, moreover, it will only be a way far from \"peace\".\nIf the U.S. and the West continue such farce, the world will only watch the ruined shaman's rites.\nIf they truly want the solution of the Ukrainian crisis and global peace, it would be a beneficial and right behavior for them to make both sides sit at the negotiating table fairly with sincerity, not deception and hypocrisy. -0-",

This year, it is staging frantic drills for preemptive strike at the DPRK's nuclear facilities and major military bases, under the new \"operational plan 2022\", revealing its scheme for a nuclear war against the DPRK under the eyes of the world.\nNothing can compensate the mental damage suffered by the Korean people due to the U.S. ever-escalating nuclear threat.\nThe Korean people are strictly keeping tabs on all the criminal acts made by the U.S. against the DPRK that have lasted for decades, and looking forward to the moment when the U.S. will be made to pay dearly for all its crimes, the white paper says, stating:\n\"Blood for blood!\" -- this is the DPRK's norm related to irreconcilable compensation for the losses and its unshakable will to make a retaliatory punishment. -0-",

This time the allowed scope of strike has been expanded to cover \"any target\" and the \"whole territory\" of Russia.\nThe U.S. has finally granted the Ukrainian puppets the right to unlimited use of U.S.-supplied weapons. This is little short of its official \"order of massacre\" to the puppets faithful to its strategy for hegemony and declaration of outright confrontation with Russia.\nThe recent atrocity, perpetrated with the bombs banned by international law and long-range weapons offered by the U.S., was an intentional \"murder by contract\" premeditated by the U.S. And this clearly proves that they have gone to extremes in their anti-Russia hysteria.\nRussia's stronger response for safeguarding the national interests and lives and security of its citizens is a just right to legitimate self-defence never to be refuted by anyone.\nThose who unhesitatingly issued an \"order to kill\" innocent civilians and the mad terrorists will be surely forced to pay dearly for the hideous crime.\nThe inhuman murderers and destroyers of peace can never escape stern punishment by history. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, June 30 (KCNA) -- The external policy office of the DPRK Foreign Ministry released the following press statement under the title \"We will continue to make important efforts to deter the acts of disturbing peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world\" on Sunday:\nThe U.S., Japan and ROK staged Freedom Edge, the first tripartite multi-domain joint military exercises in the waters near the DPRK from June 27 to 29.\nIn the past they staged many large and small joint military drills under various pretexts, but there had been no such a large-scale joint military drill dubbed with a special name.\nWe strongly denounce the U.S., Japan and ROK for their repeated reckless and provocative military muscle-flexing against the DPRK and other independent states in the region and once again seriously warn of the fatal consequences to be entailed by them.\nNow the international community unanimously comments that lurking behind the recent drill is the strategic design of the U.S. to escalate regional military tensions, exert pressure upon the Far East of Russia and lay siege to China.\nThe regular U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite joint military exercises clearly show that the U.S. strategy for world domination to encircle and contain independent and sovereign states and secure its military hegemony has already crossed the red-line and is bringing about a very negative change in the world security environment and geopolitical mechanical structure.\n\nFreedom Edge, typical expression of the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc\n\nThe danger of the first tripartite multi-domain joint military exercises between the U.S., Japan and the ROK lies not only in the fact that the armed forces of the three countries conducted drills in various operational spheres including the sea and air.\nThe gravity and danger of the situation lie in the fact that Freedom Edge is a product of the organization, systematization and actualization of the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc.\nThe U.S. is now claiming that the U.S.-Japan-ROK relations are just cooperative ones for strengthening regional stability and security and do not mean NATO of Asian version, but it is nothing but rhetoric to evade international criticism of the formation of an aggressive bloc.\nThe document, cooked up at the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite summit in August last year, specifies the immediate tripartite cooperation to cope with any threat faced by one of the three countries.\nThis is, in essence, reminiscent of NATO's principle of collective defense that it mobilizes its defense capabilities if a member country is attacked, regarding it as an attack on all.\nSince the Camp David confab, the U.S., Japan and the ROK have operated a real-time missile warning data sharing system under the pretext of coping with \"missile threat\" from someone to realize the integration in the field of military intelligence. They are also stepping up the integration of the military forces of the three countries by frequently staging joint military drills involving U.S. strategic assets.\nAs NATO stages annual joint military drills in all spheres including land, sea, air and cyberspace, the U.S., Japan and the ROK decided to regularly stage tripartite multi-domain joint military drills. This means that the U.S.-Japan-ROK relations have taken on the full-fledged appearance of Asian-version NATO.\nIn the final analysis, Freedom Edge served as an occasion for proving that the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc, the U.S. had been seeking to establish for decades, has become a present perfect form, not a continuous or future one.\n\nTrue intention in revitalization of exclusive military bloc\n\nAn official concerned of the U.S. Department of State recently asserted that Japan and the ROK are very good partners in coping with the threat from Russia.\nLurking behind this is the U.S. strategic scenario to use the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc as a three-horse carriage for carrying out its strategy for hegemony in not only Northeast Asia but also the rest of the world.\nAs already known, the ROK is a \"military colony\" which left OPECON (wartime operation control) in the hands of the U.S. and Japan is the largest overseas military base of the U.S, where more than 54 000 U.S. troops are deployed.\nThis hints that the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc is a war and aggression mechanism capable of standing in military confrontation against other countries at any time under the instruction and command of the U.S., unlike AUKUS, the security technology alliance of the U.S., Britain and Australia or the tripartite security cooperation between the U.S., Japan and the Philippines.\nIt is by no means fortuitous that the U.S. persistently tried to make the relations between NATO, the war machinery in Europe, and Japan and the ROK closely linked with each other.\nThe U.S., which had already pushed forward with the entry of Japan and the ROK into NATO 18 years ago, has got more frantic in realizing the organic bond between NATO and Japan and the ROK since it turned its strategic focus to the Asia-Pacific region.\nJapan and the ROK, which established partnerships with NATO and built channels of regular dialogue at the instigation of the U.S., are now taking part in the annual NATO summit and even in the NATO-led military exercises, further expanding their cooperation with NATO.\nAfter the outbreak of the Ukrainian crisis, Japan has been hell-bent on the moves to put pressure on Russia and the ROK has openly sought to provide the Nazi regime of Zelenskiy with lethal equipment. Such facts show that the close ties between NATO and the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc have reached a dangerous level.\nThe reality goes to prove that the \"inseparable relations\" between the security of Europe and the one of the Asia-Pacific region, touted by the U.S. and its vassal forces, are nothing but an excuse for realizing the political collusion and military integration between the NATO member states and pro-U.S. states in the Asia-Pacific region and encircling independent sovereign states.\n\nTo foil the alliance strategy of the U.S. is urgently needed to ensure international peace and stability\n\nThe Biden administration, in its \"Indo-Pacific Strategy Report\" and the \"National Security Strategy Report\", called on its allies in Asia and Europe to unite with each other to counter their strategic rivals.\nRecently, it has asserted that its alliance strategy is making the switch from a \"hub-and-spoke one\" of forming various bilateral alliances to a \"lattice-like one\" of forming several multi-lateral alliances cooperating with each other. It also claimed that the era of \"alliance protection\" is over and the era of \"alliance action\" has arrived.\nThis proves that the primary goal of the U.S. strategy for world domination is to form a global siege network to contain independent sovereign states which are opposed to its high-handed and arbitrary practices.\nSuch confrontational attempt of the U.S. is the root cause of fomenting political instability and military confrontation and triggering off bloody wars and touch-and-go security crises in different parts of the world.\nThe prevailing situation requires the independent sovereign states to steadily bolster up their self-defensive power to defend the security of the state and, at the same time, further strengthen mutual cooperation and concerted action so as to establish a structure of forces capable of effectively deterring the hostile forces' collective military intervention.\nThe U.S. and its vassal forces' expansion of the aggressive bloc and escalating military confrontation that wreck peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the region will be surely deterred by the powerful and coordinated counteraction of independent sovereign states.\nThe DPRK will never overlook the moves of the U.S. and its followers to strengthen the military bloc, which openly destroys the security environment on the Korean peninsula and gravely threatens global peace and stability, but firmly defend the sovereignty, security and interests of the state and peace in the region through offensive and overwhelming countermeasures. -0-",

They also launched artillery firing drills near the front, including eastern and western sectors along the southern border, all at once on July 2.\nNot content with this, the impudent enemy announced their plan to regularly stage artillery firing drills and task forces' training near the border of the DPRK and kick off various other military exercises such as large-scale combined outdoor mobile drill and joint firing drill of army and navy, in particular.\nI affirm that such an undisguised war game being staged by the enemy near the border of the DPRK is just an inexcusable and explicit provocation that aggravates the situation.\n\"War energy\" has been over-concentrated on the Korean peninsula and its vicinity to reach the brink of explosion due to various war games of the U.S. and other hostile forces and ceaseless deployment of their cutting-edge war hardware.\nFreedom Edge, the first multi-domain joint military exercises between the U.S., Japan and the ROK staged shortly ago in the waters near the DPRK, was the height of confrontational hysteria against it.

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued the following press statement under the title \"We will deter the looming serious threat with tougher strategic counteraction\" on Friday:\nThe U.S. revealed its sinister intention to further strengthen the collusion and nexus between NATO and its allies in the Asia-Pacific region, terming the just and legitimate exercise of sovereignty of the independent states including the DPRK a \"threat\" at the NATO summit held in Washington.\nThe \"Washington Summit Declaration\", cooked up and made public on July 10, goes to prove that the U.S. and NATO, reduced to a tool for its confrontation, pose the most serious threat to the global peace and security.\nThe DPRK Foreign Ministry most strongly denounces and rejects the \"declaration\", an illegal document that violates the legitimate rights of independent sovereign states and a confrontational programme that incites new Cold War and military confrontation on a global scale.\nThe U.S. moves to expand military blocs are the vicious root cause of seriously threatening the regional peace, extremely exacerbating the international security environment and sparking off worldwide arms race.\nBefore shifting on to other countries the responsibility for the deteriorated security in the Europe-Atlantic, the U.S. will have to clarify who has constantly destroyed the security environment in Europe for the past decades through NATO's reckless policy for eastward advance and expansion.\nIt should also explain who has persistently tried for the last ten-odd years to inveigle the pro-American satellite countries in Asia into NATO, before claiming that the security between the Northern Atlantic and the Asia-Pacific is linked with each other.\nWe solemnly warn that NATO's strategy for \"globalization\", pursued by the U.S., may certainly bring the danger of a worldwide war.\nThe U.S. should be held totally responsible for seriously infringing upon the sovereignty and security interests of other countries and constantly destroying the strategic stability of the world while wantonly violating the recognized principles of international law including respect for sovereignty, non-interference, equality and mutual benefit.\nThe prevailing situation requires a new force and mode of counteraction to foil the U.S. attempt for expanded military bloc, an urgent challenge to international peace and stability.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea will never overlook or avoid the looming grave threat but thoroughly deter the aggression and war threat with stronger level of strategic counteraction and defend peace and security in the region and the rest of the world. -0-",

However, we cannot but refer to the fact that they fabricated and spread groundless rumors about the DPRK.\nUnexpectedly talking about the DPRK's \"threat\" over the Middle East situation fraught with a new danger, they asserted that tragedy of bloodshed in the region is being caused by someone's \"intervention\" or \"support\".\nThis clearly proves how desperately the U.S. has stuck to the smear campaign for tarnishing the image of the dignified DPRK and \"demonizing\" it.\nEveryone understands that the Middle East crisis was arisen and Israel has steadily committed massacre despite the denunciation by the world community as the U.S. has patronized and backed the Zionists and inspired their war hysteria.\nEven major Western media recently cited the figures and data to prove that Israel's large-scale indiscriminate military attacks on Gaza Strip are ascribable to the support of the U.S., which has unsparingly offered a large amount of munitions including high-explosive bombs and various kinds of missiles in every way.\nThis being a hard fact, American politicians have persistently intrigued against the DPRK, which is far from the Middle East. What is their purpose?\nIt is well-known to everyone that the U.S. has frequently raised such sophism as someone's \"threat\" and \"provocation\" in the international arena in a bid to slander the DPRK and justify its hegemonic moves.\nHowever, the power and position of the DPRK have not been weakened but remarkably increased, further making the U.S. feel uneasy. The world people unanimously recognize this development as a \"great failure of the U.S. anti-DPRK policy\".\nSo, the way out the U.S. finally found is to mislead the public opinion as if the daily-growing global danger is attributable to the DPRK by unreasonably linking the proxy wars, staged by itself in different parts of the world, with \"the DPRK's intervention and support\" and thus divert the focus of intensive international criticism and pressure to the latter.\nGiven the U.S. politicians deliberately link the cause of the escalating tension in the Middle East with the DPRK in a bid to tide over the worst crisis which makes the U.S. driven into a predicament, their nervous prostration is seemly developing into psychosis.\nBut the truth never changes.\nNo matter what silly jargons may be let out by any riff-raffs, the heinous crimes of the U.S., the axis of evil wrecking global peace and stability, and its crime-woven history can never be covered and it is more impossible to shift the blame onto others.\nThe DPRK's responsible mission to defend peace and stability in the region and the rest of the world can never be denied by anyone's effort to infamize the DPRK, and the cheap rumors fabricated by the U.S. to justify the \"bloody dinner\" only show the poor nature of the \"only superpower\" breathing its last. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 16 (KCNA) -- The programme for socialist construction in the new era of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea, which regards the great people-first principle as its sacred political ideals, and its outstanding and energetic guidance continue to give birth to the most scientific and revolutionary strategies for great regional development and bring them to brilliant fruition in the course of the comprehensive development of our dignified state.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Un, who worked out long ago a plan to improve the people\u2019s living standards as early as possible by making effective use of the sea in conformity with the natural and geographical features of the country with long coastlines, clearly indicated the orientation and ways for positively promoting and developing offshore fish-farming and aquaculture, and has wisely led the work to put it into practice.\nAmid the stirring reality, in which the struggle for implementing the historic Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy is being waged dynamically, he had already given the WPK Central Committee a special instruction to take direct charge of and push forward with the work for setting an example to be followed by all coastal cities and counties to promote their development in a characteristic way as suited to their specific conditions by making the most effective use of marine resources. True to his special instruction, Sinpho in South Hamgyong Province, a typical coastal city with a small area under cultivation compared to its population, was set as a model for this year and preparations have been made to this end.\nOn July 15,Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, together with senior officials of the Party and the government, visited the Phungo-dong area in Sinpho, South Hamgyong Province, and looked round the site of an offshore farm to be built, acquainting himself with the project plan. He then convened a consultative meeting of officials concerned on the spot.\nPresent there were Kim Tok Hun, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and premier of the Cabinet, Jo Yong Won, Ri Il Hwan, Kim Jae Ryong, Pak Thae Song and other secretaries of the WPK Central Committee, Pak Jong Gun, vice-premier of the Cabinet and chairman of the State Planning Commission, major commanding officers of the armed forces organs and relevant officials in the province and in the design sector.\nKim Jong Unpresided over the meeting.\nThe meeting discussed the issues arising in building the Sinpho City Offshore Farm into a new fine model for shallow-sea culture, generalizing it to bring about a substantial improvement in the economic development and the people\u2019s living standards in coastal cities and counties, and more dynamically pushing forward with the Party\u2019s regional development policy.\nReferring to the purpose of the convening of the meeting,Kim Jong Unanalyzed the economic potential of the seas and the importance and significance of their effective exploitation and use of their resources by the coastal cities and counties in successfully bringing about the epochal change in the 10-year revolution for the regional development which has entered the full-scale phase of its implementation, and set forth practical tasks and ways to this end.\nHe stressed that developing and making good use of their natural and economic resources in regions is very important to secure the independence and driving force of the regional economic development and, furthermore, to develop the country\u2019s economic potentials in a unified and development-oriented way.\nHe said that only when the regions create an atmosphere for balanced and competitive growth by building up the foundations for their independent and sustainable development in all the local areas, can the regional economy develop, and the more the regional economy develops, the greater the motive power of the overall economy will become, contributing to the strategic economic potential growth.\nThe consultative meeting heard the data on the economic profits and effectiveness of the Sinpho City Offshore Farm.\nKim Jong Unseriously analyzed the reasons why the Party\u2019s policy on developing the regional economy by making good use of the mountains in mountainous areas and the sea in the coastal regions has not been implemented so far. He stressed that the policies consistently maintained by the Party on narrowing the gaps between urban and rural areas in economic life can be implemented only when the state provides all the conditions and possibilities for the economic growth in regions in a responsible manner.\nSaying that if the scallop and kelp farming is conducted well in the waters off the Phungo-dong area the city of Sinpho, which is poor in economic potentials, can become the richest among the cities and counties in the country in three to four years, he expressed his determination to successfully build up the Sinpho City Offshore Farm into a model of aquaculture in the new century and present it to the people in the city as a gift.\nHe continued that it is the unique ties between the WPK and the army, their most sacred tradition and the decisive guarantee for victory in the revolution that when the Party leading the revolution plans any project, the army unconditionally carries it out, always holding it as an honourable historic mission. He entrusted the construction of the Sinpho City Offshore Farm to the Korean People\u2019s Army units.\nHe expressed expectation that the KPA, absolutely loyal to the Party\u2019s ideas, leadership and orders, would successfully build the model of offshore farming, to which the state attaches importance, and present it to the Party and the people as an outcome of its steadfast revolutionary stand and patriotic spirit.\nHe stressed the need for relevant units to responsibly carry out the tasks assigned to them as regards the construction of the Sinpho City Offshore Farm.\nHe instructed the Party Central Committee to set a creative example to be generalized and applied to other parts of the country by taking direct charge of the construction of the farm and powerfully and substantially pushing ahead with it. He also made sure that a division in charge of offshore farm construction was set up in the non-permanent committee for promoting the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy to exclusively supervise and guide the construction of aquaculture bases in other coastal cities and counties.\nPointing out that the layout of the farm, submitted by the design sector, was not worked out at the level appropriate to a model creation of the aquacultural industry in the new century, he stressed the need to conduct a sincere study in a more innovative manner and create a new one so as to make the construction of the farm another revolutionary stage of development in designing industrial facilities, and indicated the orientation of designing.\nLike all other undertakings, the development of aquaculture should be based on scientific guarantee and calculation along with proactive introduction of advanced technologies, he said, calling for giving priority to the selection of superior strains and paying primary attention to raising the scientific level to the maximum in the whole process, ranging from the management of the sea-farming ground to the preservation of ecological environment.\nThe consultative meeting took relevant measures after specifying practical tasks, including those for the senior city and county officials to comprehensively investigate the natural and geographical features and economic potentials of the regions under their charge and conduct a scrupulous study and organizational work to fully exploit them, to perfect the legal and institutional mechanisms to make the preferential measures for regional economic development prove effective, and to direct efforts to training core technicians and skilled workers in all cities and counties.\nAfter the meeting,Kim Jong Unwent round the waters for aquaculture by the farm.\nLearning about the shellfish farming under way on a trial basis, he said that the waters off the Phungo-dong area are favourable for aquaculture in various aspects, including water quality, depth and temperature. With his heart filled with deep emotion, he pictured in his mind the morrow of the Sinpho citizens who will enjoy happiness along with the wonderful change in their region.\nConvinced of the sure prospects of aquaculture and the possibility of its development, all the officials, who took part in the consultative meeting in the presence ofKim Jong Un, made a firm pledge to perform remarkable feats in the proudest and most worthwhile struggle by remaining true to their mission and duty in the struggle for placing the current new phase of regional development on a track of rapid promotion.\nThe consultative meeting will be recorded in history as a crucial watershed that set up an epochal milestone for the regional economic development of our own style and as today\u2019s \u201cChangsong Joint Conference\u201d that instilled into all the Party members and other people stronger confidence in the creation of a new life and happiness. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- The leadership of the great father, who always works with devotion through creative thinking to provide our people with the most civilized and happiest life, gave birth to another legendary tale of love in the Wonsan Kalma area, which is turning into a wonderful cultural tourist resort for the people.\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, gave field guidance over the construction of the Wonsan Kalma coastal tourist area on July 16.\nAccompanying him were Kim Tok Hun, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the WPK and premier of the Cabinet, and Jo Yong Won, Ri Il Hwan, Kim Jae Ryong, Pak Thae Song and other secretaries of the Central Committee of the WPK, Pak Jong Gun, vice-premier of the Cabinet and chairman of the State Planning Commission, major commanding officers of the armed forces organs, officials concerned of the Central Committee of the WPK, Kangwon Province and the design sector.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Uninitiated the construction of a characteristic and modern coastal tourist city of Korean style, of which we can be proud in the eyes of the world, and visited the construction site several times to indicate the orientation and ways for the successful development project and has guided the whole course of the project step by step. Thanks to his ceaseless devotion and wise leadership, magnificent and grand scenery is unfolding as a paradise of people in Myongsasimni, a scenic spot along the East Sea of Korea.\nAll the builders have turned out in high spirits with a firm determination to successfully complete the construction of the Wonsan Kalma coastal tourist area and fully demonstrate the validity of the people-first politics of the WPK. They are performing fresh miraculous feats day after day, true toKim Jong Un\u2019s noble intention to make devoted service for the well-being of the people, so as to attain without fail the construction goal set forth by the Party Central Committee.\nFeasting his eyes on the panoramic view of the vast tourist area stretching along a 4km coastline,Kim Jong Un, with a broad smile on his face, said that it was really beautiful and spectacular and he felt refreshed both in mind and body as he saw the scenery peculiar to the picturesque coastal area, and repeatedly expressed great satisfaction at the fact that it had taken on an impeccable appearance as a world-level coastal tourist city as planned.\nHe highly praised the builders for bringing about collective innovations in ensuring both the speed and quality of construction with a death-defying spirit, true to the Party Central Committee\u2019s plan to build the tourist resort as a monumental edifice of eternal value for the people.\nHe stressed the need to further expand the successes, not slackening the high spirit, as the project had entered its final stage, calling on the commanding officials to make a more exacting demand, the builders to display redoubled efforts and the construction inspection organs to enhance their sense of responsibility and role to the maximum.\nHe held a consultative meeting with officials accompanying him on the spot to discuss the practical matters for making full preparations for the operation of the tourist area according to a well-thought-out plan as the 19th Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party had decided to open the coastal tourist area by next May.\nStressing the importance of making good preparations for the operation of the tourist area, he said it is important to build a wonderful resort but the key issue is to ensure perfect services appropriate to its class. However fashionable its facilities are, it will lower its value as a tourist resort if the level of their services is low, he added.\nNoting that the capacity of the services and its feasibility should be scientifically examined to properly select service units, he called for making preparations for operation on a full scale from now on. And he specified the orientation for doing so and took a series of important measures.\nThe meeting discussed all the issues arising in the preparations for ensuring smooth operation of the tourist area, including those of ensuring the parking space as suited to the capacity of the tourist area, building an amusement park and a leisure activity area, building up the capacity for garbage and sewage treatment and training experts for all the categories of services.\nWonsan is a coastal city of natural and geographical beauty, and, in particular, Myongsasimni at the Kalma peninsula has long been known as a famous scenic spot, he said, adding that a marine park of national value to be known to the world as the best tourist resort of the country would be successfully built and Myongsasimni will win the fame as a pride of Wonsan and a 4km-long stretch of beach crowded with the people in the near future.\nStressing that tourism should be developed in a long-term manner on the basis of the experience gained in the construction of the coastal tourist area, he said that as our country is surrounded by sea on its eastern and western sides and has many scenic spots on its eastern coast, including Mt Kumgang, Mt Chilbo, Majon, Kumya, Riwon and Yombunjin, it is needed to steadily implement the policy of concentrating on making rational use of the abundant coastal resources of tourism. And he called for taking long-term steps to exploit in a unique manner the resources of coastal tourism for sports, leisure activities and marine sightseeing.\nAfter receiving the important instructions ofKim Jong Unthat clearly indicated the path for a new development in the country\u2019s tourism and advanced guidelines and ways for achieving comprehensive rejuvenation of Korean-style socialism and providing the people with a happier life, all the officials renewed their faith that the plans and determinations of the Party Central Committee are an immutable science and truth, and made a firm pledge to fulfil their responsibility and duty in the important and worthwhile struggle for creating improved civilization for the people, remaining faithful to his leadership. -0-",

Such situation indicates that the \"right to self-defense\" advocated by Israel is nothing but a \"right\" to massacre and plunder.\nThe seizure of land committed again in the hotbed of massacre goes to fully prove that the onslaught and vandalism, being perpetrated by Israel with the backing of the U.S. on pleas of an exercise of the \"right to self-defense\" and \"defensive action,\" constitute genocide to drive the Palestinians out of their home and eternally occupy their territory.\nThe \"right to self-defense\" is inappropriate to Israel as it is a hideous occupier and destroyer of regional stability that has expanded its territory through bloody aggression and massacre against Palestinians and other Arab peoples, while persistently hindering the legitimate foundation of the State of Palestine.\nIt is the height of double-standards and a tragedy of this world that the U.S. and the West, which often call for respecting nations' self-determination specified in the UN Charter and international law, have connived at the most outrageous territorial expansion being pursued by the Zionists.\nThis jungle-law-prevailing reality, in which one cannot but shed tears if his fist is not strong, requires us to fully cement our strength for self-defense, the foundation of our nation's existence and guarantee for its eternal development, to be invincible. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is running high fever in its move to expand the overall structure of confrontation against the DPRK.\nAccording to the data released on July 21, more than ten FA-18 Super Hornets belonging to an attack squadron of the U.S. marines, named Fighting Bengals, were recently deployed in the Suwon Air Force Base in Kyonggi Province of the ROK.\nThe U.S. Defense Department said that it is aimed at providing the experience in operation in the Indo-Pacific region, adding that these fighters are training to increase their preparedness and the power of fatal blow with its ally.\nAnd as if threatening someone, it opened to the public the several FA-18 Super Hornets taking off.\nIt is said that these fighters will stay in the ROK in and after August for different joint exercises.\nIt is known to the world that FA-18 Super Hornet is the one for special warfare which has its mission to hit the major bases and the \"war command\" of the other party with JDAM and other precision guided bombs in the way of \"high-density strike\".\nThe ROK military side, encouraged by the bluffing of its master, said that \"as the powerful air forces of the U.S. marines are permanently deployed in fact, the effect of increasing the deterrence against the north is also expected\".\nThis being a hard reality, a few days ago, the U.S. made a spokesperson for the Department of State, the U.S. ambassador to the ROK and others let loose a spate of rhetoric about dialogue, saying that the U.S. policy toward the DPRK including dialogue remains unchanged and the door of negotiations with the DPRK is still opened.\nThe confrontation maniacs, suffering from the endemic like the \"hostility toward the DPRK\", are talking about honeyed dialogue. This is prompted by the ulterior intention to easily realize their ambition for stifling the DPRK by leading it to mental and psychological slackness.\nDialogue with sinister attempt and such dialogue as an extension of confrontation are needless to be held from the outset.\nThrough the decades-long relations with the U.S., the DPRK has keenly and fully felt what the dialogue brought to it and what it lost.\nWatching the whole course of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue, the fair international community has already come to a conclusion that the U.S. is a perfidious country which does not fulfill its promises, saying this or that.\nThe DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework was adopted as a result of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue during the Clinton administration, but the U.S. had put the brake on its implementation under this or that pretext and completely scrapped it while entering the Bush administration.

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is running high fever in its move to expand the overall structure of confrontation against the DPRK.\nAccording to the data released on July 21, more than ten FA-18 Super Hornets belonging to an attack squadron of the U.S. marines, named Fighting Bengals, were recently deployed in the Suwon Air Force Base in Kyonggi Province of the ROK.\nThe U.S. Defense Department said that it is aimed at providing the experience in operation in the Indo-Pacific region, adding that these fighters are training to increase their preparedness and the power of fatal blow with its ally.\nAnd as if threatening someone, it opened to the public the several FA-18 Super Hornets taking off.\nIt is said that these fighters will stay in the ROK in and after August for different joint exercises.\nIt is known to the world that FA-18 Super Hornet is the one for special warfare which has its mission to hit the major bases and the \"war command\" of the other party with JDAM and other precision guided bombs in the way of \"high-density strike\".\nThe ROK military side, encouraged by the bluffing of its master, said that \"as the powerful air forces of the U.S. marines are permanently deployed in fact, the effect of increasing the deterrence against the north is also expected\".\nThis being a hard reality, a few days ago, the U.S. made a spokesperson for the Department of State, the U.S. ambassador to the ROK and others let loose a spate of rhetoric about dialogue, saying that the U.S. policy toward the DPRK including dialogue remains unchanged and the door of negotiations with the DPRK is still opened.\nThe confrontation maniacs, suffering from the endemic like the \"hostility toward the DPRK\", are talking about honeyed dialogue. This is prompted by the ulterior intention to easily realize their ambition for stifling the DPRK by leading it to mental and psychological slackness.\nDialogue with sinister attempt and such dialogue as an extension of confrontation are needless to be held from the outset.\nThrough the decades-long relations with the U.S., the DPRK has keenly and fully felt what the dialogue brought to it and what it lost.\nWatching the whole course of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue, the fair international community has already come to a conclusion that the U.S. is a perfidious country which does not fulfill its promises, saying this or that.\nThe DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework was adopted as a result of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue during the Clinton administration, but the U.S. had put the brake on its implementation under this or that pretext and completely scrapped it while entering the Bush administration. This is a typical example.\nIt admits of no argument about the reliability as regards the political climate of the U.S. which \"cooks\" at random the inter-state agreement solemnly declared before the world in conformity with the \"taste\" and \"feeling\" of the political faction in power whenever the government is replaced and throws away it like \"waste\".\nAll facts go to prove that the U.S. is a \"backward country and rogue state in politics\" which makes no scruple of turning over the inter-state treaty and agreement in a moment.\nAmid the full-dress presidential election race in the U.S., Trump, who has been officially confirmed as a candidate for the Republican Party, said in his speech of acceptance for candidate that \"I got along with them and it is nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons and otherwise\", thus buoying a lingering desire for the prospects of the DPRK-U.S. relations.

At that time, the school was near a factory and it was a single-storied building, very small in size compared to the growing number of students.\nThe President said that the school construction issue should be discussed before the consultative meeting.

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 28 (KCNA) -- All the people and service personnel of the DPRK are grandly celebrating July 27, the day of great war victory recorded in the history of the country with immortal gold letters. They are extending sincere respect and warm congratulations to the defenders of the country in the 1950s, the most heroic generation and indomitable models that brought about the eternal glory of a powerful Korea.\nThe legendary feats the victorious wartime generation performed in saving the state and nation and their future, honourably defending peace and security of mankind and laying a solid foundation for building a rich country with a strong army, true to the ideology and guidance of the leader, are shining forever along with their noble name, and the matchless ideological and spiritual strength the brave warriors displayed in the war serves as an invincible might guaranteeing the steady and victorious advance of the cause of Juche.\nA meeting with the victorious wartime generation took place in Pyongyang, the capital city of the DPRK, on July 27, the 71st anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War with the sense of mission of the successors developing to firmly carry forward the great spirit of defending the country and the tradition of victory.\nThe Pyongyang Indoor Stadium, venue of the meeting, was filled with the pride of the victorious wartime generation that provided a precious asset to be handed down to posterity with ardent patriotism, loyalty and devotion and the ideological and spiritual heritage of the country and its people, and the warm respect of the younger generation for the revolutionary elders and the great pride of all the participants in being citizens of the victor nation.\nThe participants greeted with enthusiastic applause the war veterans and persons of wartime merits who were entering the venue of the meeting, wearing orders and medals shining with the proud feats of defeating the U.S. imperialists amid the playing of the light melody of the song \"July 27, Our Victory Day.\"\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was present at the meeting.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Unarrived at the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium and met war veterans who had worked for a long time at important posts of the Party, government and military, and exchanged warm greetings with them.\nWhenKim Jong Unappeared on the platform together with war veterans amid the playing of welcome music, all the participants broke into enthusiastic cheers of \"Hurrah!\" looking up toKim Jong Un, incarnation of the great dignity and strength of our invincible Party and powerful state and the banner of all victories and glory.\nChildren presented bouquets toKim Jong Unand war veterans.\nWaving back to the enthusiastic cheering crowds,Kim Jong Unextended warm congratulations to war veterans and all the civilians and service personnel across the country on the anniversary of victory.\nMembers of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and other senior officials of the Party, government and military were present there together with the participants in the celebrations of the 71st anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War, officials of the Party Central Committee, service personnel, officials and persons of merits of ministries, national agencies and Pyongyang Municipality, students of revolutionary schools, university students and schoolchildren.\nPresent there at invitation were diplomatic envoys and members of missions of foreign countries in Pyongyang.\nThe national anthem of the DPRK was played.\nRi Il Hwan, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, made a speech.\nOn the authorization ofKim Jong Unand the Party and the government, he warmly congratulated the war veterans, all the civilians and service personnel who greeted the V-Day with precious memories and great pride, and paid high tribute to the heroic soldiers and patriots who fell in the sacred war for defending the country.\nIt is the pride of our state and people and fortune of the younger generation that we have a significant meeting with creators and personifiers of the great history on the most precious holiday of the country, he said, adding that it is the honour of our generation to remember not only with pain but also with honour the dramatic era that turned the years of the most disastrous war into those of greatest victory.\nThanks to the honour of war victory, our state could have a remarkable strength that can be gained only by a victor nation and the Korean people could have acquired a valuable spiritual wealth which could not be obtained in ordinary days and which could not be learned by reading thousands of books, he said.\nIt is the proud tradition and characteristics of the Korean revolution to have created and defended the more than 70 years with the wartime spirit, he said, stressing that the defenders of the country in the 1950s who honourably safeguarded the glorious DPRK and provided the immortal heroic spirit are genuine patriots and models of ardent revolutionaries who would be praised and learned from for ever.\nHe said that today's grand festival is the peak of honour provided together by the generation who won victory in the war and the successors' generations who have bravely carried out the mission of defenders while turning the decades, which were no less arduous than the war, into the ones of legendary miracles and leaps forward in defence of the victory.\nThe spirit of the victorious wartime generation is the immortal soul that makes us demonstrate our dignity as an eternally powerful and great people, and we will win greater and more valuable victories by dynamically carrying it forward, he said, extending once again heartfelt thanks and best wishes to the war veterans who devoted their great soul to the ever-lasting history of victory and to the ever-victorious country.\nThe participants watched a video showing the feats and fighting spirit of the victorious wartime generation.\nThe war on the newly-built DPRK, a genuine people's country in the eastern part of the earth, was the enforcement of the U.S. imperialists' strategy for world domination aimed at enslaving our country, Asia and, furthermore, the whole of mankind. The confrontation with the arrogant imperialist ringleader with more than 100 years of history of aggressive war was an enormous challenge to our country with a history of less than two years after its founding.\nThe scenes showed that the Korean war forced by the U.S. imperialists was a war of unprecedented massacre, during which innocent people, nearly one-sixth of the total population of the DPRK at the time, were killed, outnumbering the fallen soldiers, and a great turmoil beyond human imagination in its brutality, atrocity and cruelty.\nThe war veterans and persons of wartime merits recalled the shock of 70-odd years ago, when all the people turned out in the do-or-die resistance for the future of a powerful country to change the course of history and define the direction of the course only with victories cherishing the solemn mission to prove that the DPRK was no longer a weak country and its people were never a weak people and the unbreakable self-respect.\nOther scenes showed that the rifles, which were used to kill more enemies with bayonets than bullets in battles where the difference in forces between the enemy and the DPRK could not be compared, were loaded with all the strength of miracles and indomitable spirit that brought about the great war victory.\nThe participants keenly realized the soul and spirit the victorious wartime generation had cherished, seeing the soldiers who carved on the rock a pledge of loyalty to the leader before death-defying, hand-to-hand fight, the soldiers who pressed the trigger of heavy machine-gun with the jaw after being wounded in the arms and legs and who blocked the enemy\u2019s pillboxes with their chests when hand grenades ran out, and the flags of the DPRK that were hoisted on the hills at the cost of blood and lives of the soldiers.\nThe historic scenes proved that the rear was also the front for the people who fought for victory in the war, with ardent love and bitter hatred, the day of victory was brought earlier and the precious tradition to be preserved and glorified forever was prepared thanks to the all-people movements including the movement of volunteering for military service on the front, emulation drive for increased production, drive for extra-haulage, women\u2019s movement to plough the fields, high-yield movement and the campaign for donating grains for the front.\nAll the participants realized once again that the wise leadership of PresidentKim Il Sung, who led the war with his outstanding military strategic ideas and tactics and brought up ordinary people into the masters of the heroic era with his warm love and trust unprecedented in history, and the unshakable faith of all the people and service personnel that they were sure to win as they were led by him were the key to winning victory in the war.\nThe scenes showing the might of the DPRK which defends its sovereignty, national interests and genuine peace with matchless self-defensive capability that can defeat any formidable enemy impressively taught all those who grew up in this powerful country free from the worries of the outbreak of war the truth that the history of winning the victory is great, but the history of succession which has defended and steadily carried it forward is still more ennobling.\nThe bouquets presented by the younger generation to the war veterans, who devoted themselves to the victory only and to the great power associated with the desire of their comrades-in-arms, were an expression of boundless reverence and ardent respect for them.\nAll the participants renewed their firm will to carry forward the glorious tradition of victory for ever by remaining loyal to the ideas and leadership of the great Party Central Committee which is cementing the military powerful strength for the future of the revolution and the nation.\nArmy Colonel Ri Un Ryong and Navy Lieutenant Commander Yu Kyong Song, officers of the Korean People's Army, made oath-taking speeches.\nExpressing their impression of seeing the fateful moments on the screen that the victorious wartime generation faced and the days of the fierce war, the speakers said that the matchless bravery and feats of many heroic soldiers who won the great victory, made them more keenly aware of the important mission of the defenders standing on the defence line of the country.\nThey said that our revolutionary armed forces have grown to be a personifier of extraordinary courage, strength and dignity, confident of victory, looking down at any formidable enemy, thanks to the revolutionary spirit and immortal feats of the victorious wartime generation, who turned the fateful years which could have ended in tragedy into the most proud ones.\nOut of surging hatred against the U.S. imperialists and the puppet ROK military gangsters hell-bent on provoking a nuclear war beyond the southern border of the DPRK even at this moment, they expressed their will to glorify with greater miracles and victories the feats of the guards units which struck the enemy with fear of ruin and brought about brilliant results in the battles and the legendary tale in the world history of naval battle, in which four torpedo boats sank a heavy cruiser of the U.S. Navy.\nThe speakers solemnly pledged beforeKim Jong Unand the Party and the state to become brave fighters in defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity and the territorial waters of the country, bearing in mind the lifetime intentions and requests of the war veterans, and to bolster up the thoroughgoing capability to cope with war and fighting efficiency in every way so as to make an overwhelming attack on the enemy anytime and without delay and annihilate them once Supreme CommanderKim Jong Ungives an order.\nWhen the meeting was over, enthusiastic cheers resounded in the venue again.\nKim Jong Unwished for long life in good health of all the war veterans, who have lived with struggle and devotion for the prosperity of their beloved country and happiness of their descendants and left beautiful traces in their life, and extended warm greetings to all the participants for a long time, hoping that they will all cherish the sacred dignity and honour of being citizens of the victor nation and firmly carry forward the soul of the victorious wartime generation.\nAll the participants were deeply moved by his world of noble revolutionary obligation and comradely love for the war veterans.\nThe meeting with the victorious wartime generation held on the occasion of the 71st anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War marked a significant occasion for redoubling the unshakable faith, courage, enthusiasm and fighting will of all the people and service personnel of the country to firmly carry forward the history and tradition of the sacred victory, glorify them for all ages and achieve without fail the great cause of building a rich country with a strong army as desired by the victorious wartime generation under the leadership of the great Party Central Committee. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) --Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, visited the flood-hit areas in the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County of North Phyongan Province on July 28.\nHe was accompanied by Jo Yong Won and Pak Thae Song, secretaries of the Central Committee of the WPK.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Unwas greeted on the spot by Pak Jong Chon, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, the minister of National Defence and other commanding officers of the Korean People's Army.\nHe guided the work for the rescue and evacuation of the inhabitants from the areas hit by a downpour and disaster-predicted areas.\nOn July 27, a record downpour struck the northern border of the DPRK and the areas of the Chinese side and the water level of the Amnok River far exceeded the danger line. This created a serious crisis, in which more than 5 000 inhabitants were isolated in the zones vulnerable to flooding in several island areas of the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County of North Phyongan Province.\nImmediately after the crisis occurred, leading officials of the Party, government and military were dispatched rapidly to the spot and helicopters of the Air Force of the KPA and various kinds of lifeboats of the Navy and a maritime guard formation of the Border Guards were promptly committed to the operation for rescuing the inhabitants according to the assignment directly given byKim Jong Un.\nAfter arriving at an air base, where the rescue operation was under way, by driving along flooded rough roads,Kim Jong Unlearned from commanding officers about the inhabitants in the flood-prone zones and the situation of the rescue operation.\nHe personally guided the operation, watching the whole course of the operation by ten-odd helicopters rescuing the inhabitants in the unfavourable weather conditions and emergency while making more than 20 rounds of consecutive shuttle flights.\nThe rescued people saw him waiting for them at the airport exposed to heavy rainstorm so unexpectedly and broke into cheers, shedding tears of deep gratitude and emotion.\nKim Jong Uninstructed the regional Party organizations and power organs to offer medical assistance to the rescued people by enlisting all possibilities lest they should feel any slight inconvenience.\nAs he talked with commanding officers and pilots of the air unit, he heard the situation in the afflicted areas and repeatedly requested them to rescue everyone without fail. He also saw to it that reconnaissance flights were reorganized several times even in the areas where the rescue operation was completed.\nHe encouraged the pilots who successfully rescued more than 4 200 people and shook hands with every one of them. He said with pleasure that the helicopters' rescue of so many people from the flooded areas in a little over a quarter of a day is an incredible miracle and a living example of air rescue operation and that it is a source of pride of our Party and state to have such excellent people\u2019s Air Force and it is his honour to be the supreme commander of such an army.\nHe highly appreciated the amazing feats performed in the rescue operation, saying that the characteristics of the people's Air Force faithful to its inherent mission were clearly demonstrated once again and that all the people across the country would feel grateful to the devoted efforts made by the Air Force and its spirit of unconditionally and death-defyingly serving the people.\nIn particular, the commander of a helicopter group fulfilled a difficult task for rescue flight in the van and possesses splendid capabilities and qualifications as a commanding officer, he said, adding delightedly that he has found out in a combat environment another excellent commanding officer to be emulated by the entire army. And he warmly encouraged him, patting him on the back.\nHe set forth the tasks and ways for concentrating all efforts on the rehabilitation and relief work to minimize the losses caused by the disaster and eradicate its aftermath as soon as possible and for taking timely measures aimed at preventing recurrence in the future.\nSaying that the flood damage in the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County is very serious, he stressed that leading officials and forces at all levels in the capital city and regions should be mobilized ideologically and promptly in the rehabilitation project while giving top priority to the protection of people's lives and property.\nHe said that primary attention should be paid to the medical prevention and treatment and the provision of living conditions for the flood victims to quickly stabilize their living and, in this regard, the Party and power organs in the relevant regions should supply relief goods including foods, medicines and daily necessities fully to the victims and console them, and that state support measures should be taken simultaneously.\nHe gave an instruction on convening an emergency meeting, saying that immediate steps should be taken to prevent further disasters as downpour is still expected in this region and full preparations made in advance to start taking permanent rehabilitation measures at once immediately after the danger of flooding has disappeared.\nSome areas in the counties on the shore of the Amnok River in North Phyongan, Jagang and Ryanggang provinces, including the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County, should be declared as special-level disaster emergency areas, and the Cabinet, commissions, ministries, national agencies, public security and armed forces organs and other institutions at all levels should  turn out in the damage prevention and rehabilitation campaign with all their forces and equipment so as to quickly remove the damage and restore the order of production and life to a normal level, he said, adding that important measures will be taken to this end.\nNoting that it is the most important and responsible task to take prior measures for preventing any accident rather than making haste for taking follow-up steps after its occurrence, he stressed the need for all regions and relevant sectors to remain alert on the highest level, so as to cope with the rainy season constantly bringing danger of flood damage, and pay the most primary attention to such undertakings for preventing the recurrence of flood damage as finding out and removing risk factors in advance, evacuating the inhabitants in a predictable and timely way and establishing a scientific flooding forecast and orderly information and control system.\nIt is important to take thoroughgoing rehabilitation measures, but I cannot but mention again the serious lesson taught by the present grave situation, he said, severely criticizing officials of relevant state organs and regions for their negligence of duty that caused the inevitable disastrous situation owing to their failure to take any flood prevention measures.\nNoting that he has already stressed more than once that proper emergency response measures should be taken to prevent damage by downpour, flooding and typhoon, he said:  I've already given a repeated warning to the irresponsible attitude to such serious practices on the part of officials. And the state repeatedly gave a precaution before the rainy season and the National Emergency Response Committee met on July 22, just a few days ago. But I can\u2019t understand why officials at major posts are not yet on red alert with regard to the natural disaster prevention work. Their indolence and expediency have reached a very serious level.\nWhenever they made a mistake, officials say they have realized its seriousness and will make redoubled efforts, but natural disasters still fail to be prevented, he said, adding:   This is due to the fact that, seized with defeatism in the struggle against natural disaster, they have not turned out with confidence in the disaster prevention work, hoping for the best while making themselves reliant entirely on the weather.    Consequently, though the National Emergency Response Committee has met on a regular basis and the emergency response committees were organized and have been operated in the capital city and provinces, they remain only in form, failing to play practical functions and roles.\nSaying that as was revealed this time, disaster prevention institutions were helpless as they had secured no proper essential rescue means to be used in case of disaster and so, the army was compelled to be seconded to the rescue operation, he seriously pointed out that what could not be overlooked any longer is just the irresponsible and non-militant attitude of the public security organ responsible for thoroughly defending the life and security of the people.\nThe county emergency disaster response commanding group and the Ministry of Public Security caused a temporary confusion in the rescue operation due to their failure in properly grasping even the number of the people in the areas vulnerable to the disaster and the number of the people rescued by the KPA was much larger than the number they had reported, he noted, saying this clearly showed what a serious phase their irresponsibility reached in direct proportion to the miraculous successes made by the KPA in rescuing the lives of more than 5 000 people.\nHe said that it is a quite ignorant and dishonest attitude to leave the lives and property of the precious people and the wealth of the country to the mercy of nature, as seen through the current flood damage in some parts of the country. And he stressed that it is quite possible to prevent any accident, if the disaster prevention work is seriously accepted as a matter of attitude and viewpoint on service toward the state and people and an important political and ideological matter, not merely a campaign against natural disaster, and measures are taken with high alertness to foresee even the worst situation.\nHe stated that, through this opportunity, cautions are given to all Party and power organs across the country so as to prevent all manner of damage by the disastrous abnormal weather. -0-",

He then proposed to strictly punish those who severely neglected their responsible duties assigned by the Party and the state and thus caused even casualties, a practice that cannot be pardoned.\nSaying that the people are observing the meeting even at this moment as they trust the Party, he underscored the need to take all measures in a powerful and detailed manner to remove the aftermath as soon as possible, mindful of the expectation of the people and the important mission before them, and set forth important tasks and ways to this end.\nHe stressed that measures should be taken to urgently supply the reserve materials for emergency disaster relief to quickly stabilize the living of the people in the flood-hit areas, and that the Cabinet and relevant ministries and national agencies should be actively mobilized in this work.\nHe detailed the practical issues arising in the rehabilitation work, including those of correctly surveying the damage and losses in provinces and, on this basis, making a scientific calculation of the scale of rehabilitation projects, manpower and budget, of ensuring promptness in the projects by enlisting the design forces in the capital city and regional areas without delay and giving precedence to designing and of dispatching construction workforce as soon as possible and fully supplying and transporting materials.\nSaying that it is necessary to thoroughly prevent additional damage caused by the disastrous climate in the future, he called on the meteorological forecast sector to make weather forecast in a responsible manner and on every sector and unit to make thoroughgoing preparations for preventing damage with the highest degree of awareness and, in particular, to make sure that no casualty is caused.\nCalling for dynamically pushing ahead with the work of rapidly stockpiling essential equipment and apparatuses for rescue operation at a time when disaster occurs, he made public important measures for it.\nCalling upon the participants in the meeting including members of the Political Bureau to visit the tents where the flood victims of Uiju County are staying temporarily and thus feel the sense of their heavy responsibility while directly seeing their living conditions, console and encourage them, make a deep study of detailed measures for rehabilitation, listening to their candid opinions, and submit the measures to the Political Bureau, he concluded the first-day sitting.\nThe second-day sitting took place on July 30.\nThe meeting studied the draft decision on the immediate repair of the flood damage.\nThe decision \u201cOn rapidly repairing the flood damage in North Phyongan and Jagang provinces,\u201d which additionally reflected the results of study and opinions of the participants, was adopted with unanimous approval at the meeting.\nThe meeting appointed Ri Hi Yong, former first deputy department director of the Organizational Leadership Department of the WPK Central Committee, as chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, Pak Song Chol, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, as chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK and Pang Tu Sop, first deputy department director of the Department of Political Leadership over Military Affairs of the WPK Central Committee, as minister of Public Security.\nConcluding the meeting,Kim Jong Unsaid that we have faced a crisis several times, but each time we have been brave and offensive in the face of it and always worked only miracles and there is nothing impossible as long as there are the leadership of the Party and the army and people that are faithful to the Party. He ardently called for stoutly turning out in the face of this crisis and making miraculous achievements.\nThe 22nd emergency enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Eighth Central Committee of the WPK will shine long in the history of the WPK as an epochal occasion for putting the buildup of the disaster prevention and management capability of the country onto a new high and as an important political event that clearly demonstrated once again the sacred mission and people-oriented character of the WPK which gives top and absolute priority to the interests of the people and makes selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people. -0-",

On this basis, it is hell-bent on preparing a nuclear war targeting the DPRK while accelerating the integration of its nuclear armed forces with the conventional armed forces of the ROK.\nAfter the confab, the U.S., together with the Japanese stooges, held a ministerial conference on \"extended deterrence\" to \"defend\" Japan with all military forces including the U.S. nuclear weapons, and committed to \"sharing nuclear weapons\" with the war criminal state in fact.\nIt is the invariable sinister intention of the U.S. to bind the two stooges more tightly in its nuclear chain and realize its military domination over the region under the pretext of \"providing extended deterrence\".\nThe U.S., Japan and the ROK puppets staged anti-DPRK joint military exercises from January to April twice as many as those in the same period last year. It clearly shows the military ties between the master and the stooges getting unprecedentedly stronger.\nIt is as clear as noonday that if Freedom Edge, the multi-domain joint military exercises between the three parties targeting the independent and sovereign states in the region including the DPRK, is put on a regular footing, the security environment on the Korean peninsula and in the region will be driven into the worst \"catastrophe\".\nThe question is why the warmongers, who have so far staged various kinds of confabs and war rehearsals frequently to get hell-bent on military cooperation, are hyping the \"institutionalization of tripartite security cooperation\" and accelerating the tightening of military nexus at present?\nAs known, U.S. President Biden gave up his run for the presidency after caving into the ever-mounting pressure put on him to withdraw his candidacy.\nThe two servants, too, are in a pitiful position of breathing their last breath at the worst ruling crisis.\n\"Divorcement from Kishida\" has been witnessed in the class supporting the Liberal Democratic Party and the support rate for the Cabinet has dropped continuously since the birth of the Kishida regime. The number of people petitioning for proposing a bill on impeachment of puppet Yoon Suk Yeol has exceeded one million and hundreds of thousands, and the impeachment becomes the main current.\nIt is the real aim of the confab and the common desperate efforts of those on death-bed to maintain the military edge of the tripartite nuclear alliance in the region by specifying in a document that the \"security cooperation\" would be further intensified no matter the regimes change in the three countries.\nThis is well evidenced by the remarks of the defense minister of the puppet ROK that \"the U.S., Japan and ROK security cooperation continues whether the regime is replaced or the Democratic Party stays in power in the U.S.\nIt is the fixed will of the DPRK to thoroughly contain and frustrate the ever-increasing reckless and provocative hostile acts of the U.S. and its servants with overwhelming and powerful self-defence capability, no matter what attempt and choice the enemies make, in order to defend peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region.\nHistorically, the more desperately the U.S. and its vassal forces escalate their moves to stifle the DPRK, the surer the military strength of the DPRK has become. It is none other than the provocateurs who are faced with the miserable fate to really worry about their security.\nThe \"new era of tripartite cooperation\" that the U.S., Japan and the ROK praise will only bring earlier the \"tripartite ruin\". -0-",

The legendary feats of the courageous red flying corps of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea that displayed an indomitable fighting spirit are stirring the whole country.\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the WPK and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, on August 2 paid a congratulatory visit to the helicopter unit of the Air Force of the KPA that performed a miracle of air rescue operation.\nLining up at the unit\u2019s apron with national flag fluttering were the helicopters which were dispatched to the flooded areas to save the people.\nAll the officers and men, waiting for the moment of greeting the respected ComradeKim Jong Unat their unit, were filled with boundless reverence for the Supreme Commander, who, with the warmest love for the people and the will to save their lives at any cost, organized and commanded the rescue operation in a dangerous flooded area and brought about an unprecedented miracle and bestowed all laurels on them.\nWhenKim Jong Unarrived, the service personnel of the Air Force burst into cheers of \"Hurrah!\" as a token of their highest tribute and glory to the great brilliant commander.\nHe received a salute from the commander of the KPA Air Force.\nHe paid tribute to the colours of the KPA Air Force and of the unit.\nHe was greeted by leading commanding officers of the Air Force and commanding officers of the unit.\nResponding to the enthusiastic cheers, he extended warm greetings to the reliable soldiers who glorified the name of the people\u2019s Air Force with their brilliant military feats in the emergency rescue operation for implementing the special order of the WPK Central Military Commission.\nHe was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee, first vice-president of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, Pak Jong Chon, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, Kang Sun Nam, minister of National Defence of the DPRK, and Ri Yong Gil, chief of the General Staff of the KPA.\nThere took place a ceremony of awarding order to the helicopter unit that performed distinguished military feats in the sacred struggle for defending the people.\nThe national anthem of the DPRK was played.\nKim Jong Unmade a rallying speech.\nIn the speech, he said:\nI wanted to proudly boast about the pilots of the helicopter unit who performed matchless feats in protecting our God-like people without an equal in the world, and out of this desire I have come to the unit on the way back from the site of repairing the flood damage. Holding a grand commendation ceremony and making the whole army learn from them and the world know about them represent the extent of the feats of the pilots and the height of the appreciation of the Party and the country.\nNo casualties occurred in the Sinuiju area, which suffered the greatest flood damage caused by the record heavy rainfall and the rapid increase in water inflow in the basin of the Amnok River. This fact cannot be expressed otherwise than a miracle. The service personnel of the Air Force demonstrated matchless combat efficiency in achieving feats by giving full play to their bravery in the face of the then dangerous weather conditions and to their expertise and perfectness in carrying out their successive missions.\nThey left another precious and honourable record that would go down in the history of distinguished military feats of our heroic army. I extend heartfelt thanks to all the service personnel of the Air Force, who protected the God-like people and firmly defended the people\u2019s trust in the Party and the government by piloting their aircraft through rain clouds and heavy rains at the risk of their lives.\nI am also thankful that all the pilots are safe although one helicopter crash-landed in an operation area on its mission.\nI also extend warm thanks to the combatants of the sharpshooter brigade of the Navy, maritime guard formation of the Border Guards and the General Reconnaissance Bureau who were involved in the rescue operation.\nThe pilots of the helicopter unit proved what the soldiers and the well-prepared unit, to be emulated by the entire army, should be like through its capability for fighting a war at the battlefield where their lives were at stake, not on a training ground for judging capability.\nSeeing the organized, professional and unhesitating combat actions of all the soldiers, who immediately launched into a rescue campaign in the unfamiliar flood-hit areas in bad weather conditions at night true to the order of the Party Central Committee, my heart grew warmer as I felt that I found a genuine model unit.\nI would like to speak highly specially of the combat spirit and deep ideological and moral world of the unit commander, who is able to stand in the vanguard before shouting an order. Our Party needs such a field commanding officer of abilities and action required by modern warfare. I was deeply moved to see him carrying out the successive and repeated missions of reconnaissance, rescue and search without showing any sign of getting tired that day. It is a real miracle to have saved more than 4 200 people within a few hours with the helicopters, totalling more than 5 000 people when those, rescued by other units which carried out their rescue mission on the water, are included.\nThese are undying feats to be described with the words heroic and miraculous as they are a success greater than shooting down 10, nay, 100 enemy aircraft and feats to be glorified and handed down in history for the character of the operation as a campaign for defending the people.\nAlthough the wonders done by heaven are constantly changing and no milestone exists in the vast open sky, our Air Force\u2019s skyway is the only one indicated by the Party and revolution. This is why the feats performed by our pilots are so honourable. I am of the belief that the pilots and all other officers and men of this unit will as ever firmly defend the cause of the Party and reliably safeguard the security of the airspace sovereignty of our state and the well-being of its people with ardent patriotism and loyalty and heroic fighting spirit.\nThe service personnel should raise more fiercely the flames of the revolution in training just as they were brave, skilled and unhesitating in the struggle for defending the people, so as to annihilate the enemy.\nThe enemy\u2019s rubbish media are spreading a false rumour that the number of casualties in our flood-hit areas is expected to be over 1 000 or 1 500 and that several helicopters are believed to have fallen on the rescue mission. Clear is the sinister purpose of those in Seoul obsessed about such a smear campaign.\nSaying that the enemy remain unchanged, he bitterly censured the inveterate habits and despicable nature of the ROK scum keen on a vicious smear campaign to disparage the DPRK and tarnish its image at any cost, and continued:\nWe will neither give up national defence for disaster relief or for the people's living nor pay less attention to their living for national defence.\nReferring to the future orientation of development of the Air Force,Kim Jong Unaffirmed that the people's Air Force would make a great contribution to ensuring national security and regional peace and stability, adding:\nThe people are our God. We should care about the inconvenience of the flood victims who are at evacuation areas even at this moment when boiling heat still rages. We should speed up the rehabilitation as much as possible. We should make the whole country brim with the communist trait of one for all and all for one the harder the times are, and in particular, our army should show utmost filial devotion to the people as befit their sons and daughters.\nExpressing his thanks again to the unit for having performed sacred feats in the campaign for defending the people, he ardently wished the heroic people's Air Force victory and glory.\nWhen his speech was over, the service personnel of the Air Force burst into thunderous cheers again.\nAll the participants expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Supreme Commander, who put them forward, who had only remained faithful to the mission of the sacred people's Air Force, as a source of pride of the Party and the state, and renewed their iron will to be always thoroughgoing and courageous in defending the sovereignty of the country and ensuring the safety and well-being of the people true to the slogan inscribed in their glorious colours.\nChoe Ryong Hae read out the decrees of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly of the DPRK on awarding the Order of Freedom and Independence 1st Class to the helicopter unit of the KPA Air Force and the title of DPRK Hero to its commander who had led the unit in the campaign for defending the people to achieve brilliant feats.\nKim Jong Unpersonally conferred the orders.\nHe affixed the Order of Freedom and Independence 1st Class to the colours of the unit.\nHe awarded the title of DPRK Hero, Gold Star Medal and Order of National Flag 1st Class to the commander of the unit.\nThe citation of the Supreme Commander of the armed forces of the DPRK was conferred on 47 pilots and flight engineers.\nThe officers and men of the Air Force broke into enthusiastic cheers, looking up with deep gratitude to the great brilliant commander who decorated their feats performed on the road of military service with the gold star while respectfully calling them the army of lifeguards of the Party Central Committee and the first death-defying corps in defending the revolution and the people.\nThe unit commander made an oath-taking speech on behalf of his unit.\nThe self-sacrificing devotion of the great father, who regards our people as part of his flesh and blood that can never be lost, constituted an inexhaustible driving force that encouraged us to brave downpour and strong wind and a key to the fighting efficiency that enabled us to bring about an unprecedented miracle in air rescue operation, he said, and made the following pledge: The red hawks of the brave Air Force of the DPRK will as ever fly along the route of loyalty and requital without even 0.001mm of deviation, cherishing the trust of the Supreme Commander and the Party Central Committee as their whole life.\nThe venue of the awards ceremony was filled with the militant enthusiasm of the participants to fully demonstrate the spiritual qualities and mettle of the people's Air Force in the struggle to death-defyingly defend the well-being, rights and interests of the state and the people by giving fuller play to the steadfast revolutionary faith, patriotic spirit and spirit of devoted service with which they have supported the ideas and cause of the great Party Central Committee in the vanguard.\nThere took place a march-past of the guard of honour of the KPA Air Force.\nKim Jong Unposed for a photo with the pilots, who performed distinguished feats in the operation for defending the people, with the glorious colours at the centre.\nHe repeatedly said with high appreciation that the steadfast officers and men of the Air Force, who share the steps of strenuous efforts and mind with the Supreme Commander to serve the people with absolute commitment, cherishing the outlook on the revolution and life that there is no greater happiness than the pride of sharing intention, will and practice with him, are a source of the highest pride of our Party and people, expressing expectation and belief that the pilots will steadily carry on the present honour with more brilliant feats.\nThe firm pledge of the air fighters to display the mettle of the WPK's red phoenix braving any flames and storm, cherishing the great love and trust shown byKim Jong Unas the mainstay of their faith, resounded far and wide in the sky of August along with the loud shouts of \"Kim Jong Un\" and \"Death-defying defence\".\nThat eveningKim Jong Unhosted a reception in congratulation of the unit\u2019s officers and men who received the orders of honour.\nLeading officials of the Party, government and military attended the reception and warmly congratulated the winners.\nThe reception was filled with the feelings of kinship and trust between the great brilliant commander and his bodyguards.\nKim Jong Un's congratulatory visit to the helicopter unit will be brilliantly recorded in the history of army building as an event filled with warm love and encouragement that put on the eminence of the times the brilliant tradition and ever-victorious militant spirit of the people's Air Force, which has always flied along the route of absolute loyalty and heroic military service to defend the country and the people, and powerfully inspired it to perform continuous feats. -0-",

It can never be justified in any case and with anything.\nThe Russian government said that any attempt of the Western countries to confiscate Russian assets will be branded as stealing and will not escape punishment and no matter what rhetoric they may make, theft will remain theft, too.\nThe unbiased world public censured it as a clear illegal one, expressing serious concern over the fact that it would be a bad precedent for the disposal of state assets in dispute and an act of harming international financial stability.\nBut the U.S. and the West are advertising their rare robbery as a well-intended act for \"peace and security\", claiming that emergency measures are necessary in the extraordinary period and there is no greater symbol than making Ukraine and the whole of Europe safer with the funds of the Kremlin.\nIs the robbery for \"peace and security\" being allowed to do?\nThere is no pretext for justifying robbery and theft in the world.\nIt is an open fact that the U.S. and the West were seeking Russia's overseas assets to fill up their financial resources which run out for the long-term crisis in Ukraine.\nAs recently disclosed by the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. national debt has reached the worst phase beyond 35 trillion US dollars and the other Western countries, too, are not placed in a position to look after others due to their poor economic situation.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine spends more than 136 million US dollars every day and more than 4 billion US dollars every month for military expenditure.\nThe Russian assets frozen by the West, which cannot but make every effort for running the Russian war machine, are no more than a lump of oily meat.\nIn order to calm down the internal differences in view and international legality at any cost, the U.S. and the West have thrust themselves into the robbery in group while competitively faking up legal frameworks for allowing the seizure of the assets of a sovereign state.\nThe EU decided to allocate 90 percent of the earnings of the frozen assets of the Central Bank of Russia to the supply of military assistance to Ukraine and the remaining 10 percent to other items. This clearly shows its real intention to prolong the bloody war and slaughter on the European Continent, not to end the war.\nNo matter how hard the U.S. and its followers may describe their act as one for \"peace in Ukraine\" and \"security in Europe\", they cannot conceal their atrocious nature turned into a worldwide gangster group. And it will be another evidence of proving their predatory, arrogant and shameless nature.\nThe world people are stunned by the ignorant and rude robbery of the U.S. and the West which is not the first and the last.\nThe U.S. and the West will have to pay dearly for their plunder, irrespective of international law, market rules, enemy or ally. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 4 (KCNA) -- A group of gangsters without wearing masks is reigning over the earth.\nShortly ago, the European Union in collusion with the U.S. committed such outrageous act as deducting 1.5 billion euros from the Russian assets it has frozen at random at financial institutions of its member states and as transferring them to weapons funds supporting Ukraine.\nThis is a violation of the principle of international law, which stipulates that the assets of another country in the territory of a country are inviolable, and a wanton encroachment on state sovereignty and private property rights. It can never be justified in any case and with anything.\nThe Russian government said that any attempt of the Western countries to confiscate Russian assets will be branded as stealing and will not escape punishment and no matter what rhetoric they may make, theft will remain theft, too.\nThe unbiased world public censured it as a clear illegal one, expressing serious concern over the fact that it would be a bad precedent for the disposal of state assets in dispute and an act of harming international financial stability.\nBut the U.S. and the West are advertising their rare robbery as a well-intended act for \"peace and security\", claiming that emergency measures are necessary in the extraordinary period and there is no greater symbol than making Ukraine and the whole of Europe safer with the funds of the Kremlin.\nIs the robbery for \"peace and security\" being allowed to do?\nThere is no pretext for justifying robbery and theft in the world.\nIt is an open fact that the U.S. and the West were seeking Russia's overseas assets to fill up their financial resources which run out for the long-term crisis in Ukraine.\nAs recently disclosed by the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. national debt has reached the worst phase beyond 35 trillion US dollars and the other Western countries, too, are not placed in a position to look after others due to their poor economic situation.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine spends more than 136 million US dollars every day and more than 4 billion US dollars every month for military expenditure.\nThe Russian assets frozen by the West, which cannot but make every effort for running the Russian war machine, are no more than a lump of oily meat.\nIn order to calm down the internal differences in view and international legality at any cost, the U.S. and the West have thrust themselves into the robbery in group while competitively faking up legal frameworks for allowing the seizure of the assets of a sovereign state.\nThe EU decided to allocate 90 percent of the earnings of the frozen assets of the Central Bank of Russia to the supply of military assistance to Ukraine and the remaining 10 percent to other items. This clearly shows its real intention to prolong the bloody war and slaughter on the European Continent, not to end the war.\nNo matter how hard the U.S. and its followers may describe their act as one for \"peace in Ukraine\" and \"security in Europe\", they cannot conceal their atrocious nature turned into a worldwide gangster group. And it will be another evidence of proving their predatory, arrogant and shameless nature.\nThe world people are stunned by the ignorant and rude robbery of the U.S. and the West which is not the first and the last.\nThe U.S. and the West will have to pay dearly for their plunder, irrespective of international law, market rules, enemy or ally. -0-",

It can never be justified in any case and with anything.\nThe Russian government said that any attempt of the Western countries to confiscate Russian assets will be branded as stealing and will not escape punishment and no matter what rhetoric they may make, theft will remain theft, too.\nThe unbiased world public censured it as a clear illegal one, expressing serious concern over the fact that it would be a bad precedent for the disposal of state assets in dispute and an act of harming international financial stability.\nBut the U.S. and the West are advertising their rare robbery as a well-intended act for \"peace and security\", claiming that emergency measures are necessary in the extraordinary period and there is no greater symbol than making Ukraine and the whole of Europe safer with the funds of the Kremlin.\nIs the robbery for \"peace and security\" being allowed to do?\nThere is no pretext for justifying robbery and theft in the world.\nIt is an open fact that the U.S. and the West were seeking Russia's overseas assets to fill up their financial resources which run out for the long-term crisis in Ukraine.\nAs recently disclosed by the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. national debt has reached the worst phase beyond 35 trillion US dollars and the other Western countries, too, are not placed in a position to look after others due to their poor economic situation.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine spends more than 136 million US dollars every day and more than 4 billion US dollars every month for military expenditure.\nThe Russian assets frozen by the West, which cannot but make every effort for running the Russian war machine, are no more than a lump of oily meat.\nIn order to calm down the internal differences in view and international legality at any cost, the U.S. and the West have thrust themselves into the robbery in group while competitively faking up legal frameworks for allowing the seizure of the assets of a sovereign state.\nThe EU decided to allocate 90 percent of the earnings of the frozen assets of the Central Bank of Russia to the supply of military assistance to Ukraine and the remaining 10 percent to other items. This clearly shows its real intention to prolong the bloody war and slaughter on the European Continent, not to end the war.\nNo matter how hard the U.S. and its followers may describe their act as one for \"peace in Ukraine\" and \"security in Europe\", they cannot conceal their atrocious nature turned into a worldwide gangster group. And it will be another evidence of proving their predatory, arrogant and shameless nature.\nThe world people are stunned by the ignorant and rude robbery of the U.S. and the West which is not the first and the last.\nThe U.S. and the West will have to pay dearly for their plunder, irrespective of international law, market rules, enemy or ally. -0-",

hearts pulsating with his extraordinary revolutionary enthusiasm and far-reaching plan, the secretary stressed.\nMaking a firm pledge, in reflection of the unanimous feelings of all the fighters in the munitions industry, to remain invariably loyal to their honourable duty as fighters in the WPK's revolutionary industry shouldering the cause of building a powerful army in the great era ofKim Jong Un, he courteously reported toKim Jong Unthat they thoroughly implemented his order.\nKim Jong Unmade a historic speech.\nAfter declaring with pride that an important item in the practical guidelines for building up the military capability, which was decided at the Eighth Congress of our Party and the enlarged meetings of the Central Military Commission of the Party held during the eighth term of the Party Central Committee, has been brought into fruition, he, in the name of the Party and government, extended warm thanks to the workers, scientists and officials in the munitions industry, who have proudly carried out their revolutionary tasks of great strategic significance in steadily developing the self-reliant national defence capability of the state.\nOn the basis of a serious analysis of the important political and military significance highlighted by the magnificent demonstration, the first of its kind ever since the founding of our country and army, the crucial changes in the military security environment facing our country and the US and its followers' ever-escalating military confrontation moves,Kim Jong Unclarified the tasks to be fulfilled in ensuring the steady development of the tremendous strength of our Republic's armed forces and the self-reliant defence industry that firmly supports it.\nNoting that independence, justice and peace are firmly guaranteed only by the absolute and matchless self-defence capability, and our eternal victory, genuine peace, happiness and wellbeing are ensured by the ever-developing powerful and limitless strength, he fervently called for waging an undaunted struggle and making uninterrupted changes and progressive successes for the independent development of the country and peaceful and prosperous new life of its people.\nThe participants were greatly excited by his speech as it clarified a clear-cut policy and fighting guidelines for infinitely developing the military capability for self-defence for most righteously and creditably defending the present and future of the country and its people in today's tough world where the confrontation of strength decides life and death.\nThey raised loud cheers of \"Hurrah!\" as a reflection of their firm resolve to bolster up the war deterrent and the capability for fighting a war to be so overwhelming that the hostile forces dare not use their military muscle against their country by equipping themselves fully with the steel-strong faith and revolutionary will of the great WPK and cementing the super-strength in the country's possession to be more absolute and irreversible.\nKim Jong Ungave written orders in the name of the chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK on equipping the first-line units of the KPA on the frontier with the new-type tactical ballistic missiles to the chief of the KPA General Staff and commanders of the large combined frontline units.\nHe personally awarded the colours and certificates of the colours of the new missile units to the commanders, political commissars and chiefs of staff of relevant units.\nStormy cheers rocked the venue of the ceremony, where a great event to be specially recorded in the history of building a powerful and modern Juche-oriented army was witnessed.\nThere was a ceremony of the combined military band.\nMembers of the band and the guard of honour added joy and militant enthusiasm to the great auspicious event by making various formation changes and showing smart rifle-handling skills to the dynamic tune of revolutionary military music.\nThere took place a demonstration march of the frontline missile artillerymen's units that received new weapons.\nThe tactical ballistic missile launchers preceded by the glorious colours moved forward, being reviewed byKim Jong Un.\nKim Jong Ungave a militant salute to the ultimate weapons that vividly reflect the patriotic souls of the red workers of the munitions industry, dedicated to the sacred cause of historic significance of the nation to firmly bolster up the world's greatest self-defensive military capability, and symbolize an epoch-making improvement of the military supremacy of the armed forces of the DPRK.\nAt the end of the ceremony, cheers of \"Hurrah!\" filled with loyalty and patriotic zeal of the participants, resounded far and wide through the nocturnal sky.\nLooking round the new-type weapons again together with leading officials of the Party, the government and the military, and commanding officers of the large combined units,Kim Jong Unexpressed belief that the latest, elite weapons, another firm stepping stone for injecting tremendous vitality into the name and flag of the DPRK and remarkably enhancing its prestige, would demonstrate their might as a powerful treasured sword in defending the sovereignty of the country and peace.\nThe commissioning ceremony of new-type tactical ballistic missile launchers, held in the presence ofKim Jong Un, will be recorded in history as a historic event which further strengthened the iron faith of the army and people, advancing under the ever-victorious leadership of the great Party Central Committee, in the validity and invincibility of their cause and their conviction in the future of the country that will endlessly become powerful and prosperous. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 5 (KCNA) -- On August 4Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and President of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, attended the ceremony of transferring and receiving new-type tactical ballistic missile system and made a speech.\nHe said:\nComrades,\nToday we have gathered for this characteristic ceremony to celebrate the transferring of new-type tactical weapons to our army.\nWe are now witnessing a moment of the course of our state's defence capability increasing day by day.\nRepresentatives of defence scientists and munitions industry workers, who have worked with devotion in the struggle to produce these tactical weapons of great military significance, which would fill up the major gaps in our state's defence capability and form a main force in our military forces,\nOfficers and soldiers of the frontline missile artillerymen\u2019s units, who will soon receive the new weapons,\nDear comrades,\nAs you see, we are now facing 250 new-type tactical ballistic missile launchers, which our munitions industry workers have produced by their own efforts and technology.\nThose weapons, lining up in columns in front of us, will be transferred to our army now and will play an important military role in the border areas of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\nThis of course means no more than attaining our first-stage goal of building missile forces in the first-line units on the front.\nEvery year we will show the whole world without filtering the procedure of the change of generations of our military hardware with new ones.\nIt is because this has enough special effect on deterring war.\nThe world is witnessing the course of development of our armed forces.\nWe have become able to take the operational initiative with the overwhelming attack forces and striking means superior to the enemy on all fronts, achieve the multifaceted nature of the spaces of firepower tasks and improve the practical effectiveness of the special physical strength, tactical nuke.\nI am very pleased to make public that an important item in the practical guidelines for building up the military capability, which was decided on at the Eighth Congress of our Party and the enlarged meetings of the Central Military Commission of the Party held during the eighth term of the Party Central Committee, has been brought to fruition.\nGreeting this moment that declares a great change in our armed forces and their prospective development, I, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, extend warm thanks to the workers, scientists and officials in the munitions industry, who have proudly carried out their revolutionary tasks of great strategic significance in steadily developing our state's self-reliant national defence capability.\nComrades,\nThanks to the firepower of this weapon system, presenting a threatening appearance for the first time since the founding of our country and army, we have become able to possess a sure and overwhelming strength with which to contain the enemy's reckless provocative moves against us.\nThe fact that these military hardware of a new generation have been produced in less than one year in the circumstances, in which the hostile forces' challenges and moves of blockade persisted on an unprecedentedly extreme degree, adequately demonstrates the potential and might of our self-reliant defence industry.\nBy waging a heroic production struggle and presenting the products encapsulating their pure conscience and ennobling outlook on life, our munitions industry workers fully demonstrated the faith and revolutionary nature inherent in them.\nWhat I am most pleased with today is that I have confirmed once again the ennobling spiritual world of the munitions industry workers, who clearly remember their lineage and origin and are faithful and dignified in remaining true to their honourable original name of successors to the Kunjari spirit.\nThe strength of our defence industry is not merely the might of our defence science. Rather, it is a strength of the absolute loyalty these workers are displaying in unconditionally and perfectly carrying out the Party's decisions and plans from the standpoint that doing so is their ennobling duty.\nAbsolute, unconditional and perfect implementation is our munitions industry workers' invariable raison d'etre, lifeline and unique quality.\nTrue to the orders of the Party Central Military Commission, the workers, scientists and officials in the munitions industry have made strenuous efforts to manufacture hundreds of cutting-edge military hardware, thereby fulfilling the strategic plan for developing our state's war deterrent to the highest level possible. By doing so, they have instilled an overwhelming sense of dignity and honour in all the patriotic people of this country, and inspired them with renewed confidence in final victory. I highly appreciate them and offer positive encouragement to them in their efforts for more proud successes.\nComrades,\nAs the relationship of the U.S.-led alliance is, in terms of its nature and character, evolving into a nuclear-based military bloc, the military security environment surrounding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is facing drastic changes, both strategically and structurally.\nThis highlights the fact that our state has no reason to rest content with its current level of war deterrent.\nTo look back on the past five years, we can see that the concept of nuclear has been associated with every military action targeting the DPRK taken by the United States, and now its vassal states have grown reckless enough to share its nukes.\nThis situation demands that we keep accelerating the development of our Republic's armed forces for maintaining their supremacy, and also of the self-reliant defence industry that provides solid support to this end.\nGenuine peace can be guaranteed only by the build-up of immense strength.\nNegotiations and confrontation are among our options, but we must be more thoroughly prepared to cope with the latter--this is the review and conclusion we have derived from the 30-odd years of dealing with the United States, and it is the keynote of our consistent policy towards the United States.\nThe fact that the United States and the groups of its top-class stooges are overstepping the mark in their outrageous military manoeuvres provides evidence for the justice of our cause, and this compels us to bolster up our self-defensive military capability more perfectly and rapidly. This will inevitably hasten the failure, shame and destruction on the part of the enemy.\nThe United States we are now confronting is by no means an administration that remains in power for a tenure of some years, but a hostile state that our descendants, too, will have to counter generation after generation. This fact testifies to the inevitability of the steady improvement of our defence capability.\nWe should possess the capability to cope on our own initiative with new, potential dangers to our security, as well as the various imminent threats by the United States. This is a crucial task for providing a long-term guarantee for defending the sovereignty, security, interests and territorial integrity of our state.\nAt present, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has built up its national system of nuclear forces, with which to promptly counter any type of threatening actions by the nuclear-armed enemy states, and we have made steady efforts to make the nuclear forces fully ready for action.\nHowever, witnessing the rapidly-changing global security environment and the reckless expansion of the U.S.-led military bloc system, we have come to a conclusion that the nuclear forces of our state and its nuclear posture should be more thoroughgoing and perfect, and we feel its necessity every day and every minute.\nOur mightiness is not what it is now, but it lies in our relentless pursuit of mightiness.\nStagnation in military supremacy is just the beginning of inferiority in defence capability.\nWe must never forget that if we rest content with the present level of supremacy that has taken so much cost for us to reach, we should pay more later.\nClear is our standpoint in coping with the U.S. moves to aggravate the situation.\nIf it continues attempting to jeopardize the security of the region in disregard of our repeated warnings, we will make the United States acutely aware that there will be fatal consequences for its own security.\nI make it clear once again: Whether engaged in negotiations or confrontation, possessing a great military strength is an obligation and right a sovereign state must never neglect or budge on at any moment.\nUnless an end is put to the nuclear threat against us, and as long as there exist the imperialist forces that resort to nukes as a means of their tyranny, there will never be a moment\u2019s halt or a breathing space on our journey for the consolidation of our nuclear war deterrent.\nOur strength will continue to evolve, and our military supremacy will deny its limits forever.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea will resolutely face both imminent and potential challenges by attaining a more refined and improved posture of its nuclear forces as soon as possible to contain any nuclear threats and defend itself from them.\nGiven the fact that the United States and its vassal forces have been tightening the screw on the DPRK by resorting to military means,Kim Jong Unsaid, it has been an indisputable option for the DPRK to make sustained efforts to increase its defence capability.\nHe went on:\nBuilding up the nuclear war deterrent and developing it to the highest level possible is the best option for effectively confronting the nuclear blackmail and multi-faceted isolation schemes by the United States and for earmarking a larger investment for economic development and improvement of the people's living standards--this is the principled standpoint we have consistently maintained over the last ten or so years since we proclaimed the new line of promoting the country's economic construction and building up its nuclear forces simultaneously, and its validity and viability have been clearly proved through practice.\nWe should always bear this in mind, and work hard to achieve the goals of the five-year strategy for defence development advanced by the eighth-term Central Committee of the Party, uncompromisingly and faultlessly, thoroughly and completely.\nThe munitions industry must never compromise on its absolute mission that increased production of military hardware provides a sure guarantee for safeguarding the country's sovereignty and enhancing its prestige; it should work hard to achieve greater and prouder successes in attaining the Party's objectives for modernizing the defence industry and in carrying out its task of producing weapons of the Juche type.\nThe army units, to which the new-type weapon system is to be transferred, should master the new system as early as possible, actively organize and conduct training in a real-war atmosphere to operate it so effectively as to maximize its efficiency in battle, and maintain a prompt and proper operational posture. In this way, they can creditably implement their military duties to deter war and take the initiative.\nWhat our proud new missile units will receive today is not merely the new weapons.\nLike all other weapons of ours, these embody our people's firm will to put an end to the threats of aggression against our Republic, as well as their spirit of self-respect to make theirs an invincible country that no force will dare to attack and their desire to develop it into a powerful nation.\nWe will continue to develop and produce more powerful and sophisticated military hardware of our own style and deploy them for action, thus ensuring that the People's Army keeps gaining in strength over time.\nThe Party Central Committee will always accompany and properly lead our munitions industry workers, both faithful and dependable, on this responsible and important journey.\nComrades,\nLet us bear in mind once again that absolute and matchless self-defence capability provides a sure guarantee for independence, justice and peace.\nEver-developing, inexhaustible\u00a0strength is fundamental to our eternal victory, genuine peace, happiness and safety.\nLet us all strive undauntedly and achieve constant transformations and innovative successes for the independent development of our great state and a peaceful and prosperous new life of our people. -0-",

Britain and other Western countries joined in it.\nBut the Middle East resistance forces, enraged by Israel\u2019s brutal massacres and the U.S. and the West patronizing them, have conducted fierce military activities, which are growing stronger day by day.\nIt is the Yemen resistance forces that have emerged as the main rival driving the U.S. and the West into a defensive in the waters of the Red Sea.\nThe resistance forces conducted military attacks to shoot down six MQ-9 Reapers, the air combat drones the U.S. is pride of, in six months and the myth of the U.S. \"mightiness\" has been completely thrown into the Red Sea.\nThey are still pressurizing the U.S. and the West, saying that their military attack will continue to increase unless Israel stops the mass killing.\nIn this regard, the international community is calling the U.S. and the Western military operations of the \"defender of prosperity\" in the waters of the Red Sea, the hopeless ones like a \"whack-a-mole game\".\nEven the U.S. military experts deplored the U.S. navy which has faced the most persistent and difficult battle after the Second World War.\nThe commanding officer of a destroyer of the U.S. forces expressed his extreme fears, saying people do not know that we are carrying out the missions under deadly threat and if we make one mistake of judgment, we are hit by missile.\nThe frightened guys are frequently attacking each other.\nIn February an escort ship of Germany, which claimed to be the latest warship, misjudged the U.S. navy's drone as enemy and launched two interceptor missiles. But they failed to reach their target and dropped into the sea. This incident clearly showed the confusion caused by fear among armed interventionists in the waters of the Red Sea and the weakness of their \u201cultra-modern equipment\u201d.\nIt is by no means accidental that the international community comments that the huge naval forces of the U.S. and the West which are not seizing a naval route against resistance forces, not a regular army, are below the level.\nBut it is one reason to consider.\nAnother reason is that the will of the anti-U.S. resistance in the Middle East not to tolerate any more U.S. acts of imprudently thrusting in its head and going arbitrary in the region is resulting in overcoming the \"superiority of force\".\nThe reality goes to prove that the Western forces headed by the U.S. that are engrossed in war and massacre in different parts of the world are bound hands and feet by the anti-U.S. sacred war in the regions for defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea released the following press statement on August 6:\nGermany announced on August 2 that it joined the\u00a0UN Command, a multinational aggression mechanism led by the U.S.\nThe UN Command is an illegal mechanism for aggressive war that the U.S. faked up by abusing the name of the UN to drag the armed forces of its vassal states into the Korean War ignited by it in 1950.\nThe DPRK Foreign Ministry strongly denounces Germany's entry into the UN Command, regarding it as an act of wrecking peace and stability on the Koran peninsula and aggravating the situation.\nThe 30th session of the UN General Assembly in 1975 adopted a resolution on dissolving the UN Command in accordance with the unanimous will and demand of the UN member states desirous of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.\nThe U.S. is attempting to revive the function of the UN Command which should have been extinct in the last century. This is aimed at turning the UN Command into the second NATO of Asian version by dragging its allies and thus militarily deter the DPRK and its neighboring countries.\nGermany's improper act is again reminiscent of its inglorious past in which it plunged mankind into the bloodbath of the Second World War and inflicted untold misfortune and pain upon mankind in the last century.\nGermany should bear in mind that its military intervention in the Korean peninsula, the biggest hotbed in the world, will act as a vicious factor in keeping up its security and image.\nGermany's entry into the UN Command is clearly not helpful to maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula and the rest of the region but an act which has a serious negative effect on the development interests of the DPRK.\nThe present ever-escalating military confrontation on the Korean peninsula demands the DPRK take more thorough measures for bolstering up its self-defensive capabilities to defend the sovereignty, security and interests of the state.\nThe DPRK Foreign Ministry notifies in advance that Germany's entry into the UN Command will inevitably aggravate the military and political situation on the Korean peninsula and the rest of the region, and that Germany will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. -0-",

Britain and other Western countries joined in it.\nBut the Middle East resistance forces, enraged by Israel\u2019s brutal massacres and the U.S. and the West patronizing them, have conducted fierce military activities, which are growing stronger day by day.\nIt is the Yemen resistance forces that have emerged as the main rival driving the U.S. and the West into a defensive in the waters of the Red Sea.\nThe resistance forces conducted military attacks to shoot down six MQ-9 Reapers, the air combat drones the U.S. is pride of, in six months and the myth of the U.S. \"mightiness\" has been completely thrown into the Red Sea.\nThey are still pressurizing the U.S. and the West, saying that their military attack will continue to increase unless Israel stops the mass killing.\nIn this regard, the international community is calling the U.S. and the Western military operations of the \"defender of prosperity\" in the waters of the Red Sea, the hopeless ones like a \"whack-a-mole game\".\nEven the U.S. military experts deplored the U.S. navy which has faced the most persistent and difficult battle after the Second World War.\nThe commanding officer of a destroyer of the U.S. forces expressed his extreme fears, saying people do not know that we are carrying out the missions under deadly threat and if we make one mistake of judgment, we are hit by missile.\nThe frightened guys are frequently attacking each other.\nIn February an escort ship of Germany, which claimed to be the latest warship, misjudged the U.S. navy's drone as enemy and launched two interceptor missiles. But they failed to reach their target and dropped into the sea. This incident clearly showed the confusion caused by fear among armed interventionists in the waters of the Red Sea and the weakness of their \u201cultra-modern equipment\u201d.\nIt is by no means accidental that the international community comments that the huge naval forces of the U.S. and the West which are not seizing a naval route against resistance forces, not a regular army, are below the level.\nBut it is one reason to consider.\nAnother reason is that the will of the anti-U.S. resistance in the Middle East not to tolerate any more U.S. acts of imprudently thrusting in its head and going arbitrary in the region is resulting in overcoming the \"superiority of force\".\nThe reality goes to prove that the Western forces headed by the U.S. that are engrossed in war and massacre in different parts of the world are bound hands and feet by the anti-U.S. sacred war in the regions for defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- The sacred leadership of the great father, who with warm love and ennobling spirit of making devoted service for the people as his natural character, continues the long journey of devoted service for their wellbeing while dedicating his tireless thinking and efforts to the sake of the people all the time, has touched the flood-stricken people again, redoubling their confidence in and optimism about the future.\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, visited the flood-hit area in Uiju County of North Phyongan Province again on August 8 and 9 and took important measures for rehabilitation.\nHe, who pioneered an honorable campaign for providing the homeless people in the disaster-stricken areas with fine homes as soon as possible, visited again the flood victims of Uiju County on August 8.\nHe was accompanied by Jo Yong Won, Pak Jong Chon, Kim Jae Ryong, Ju Chang Il and Han Kwang Sang, leading officials of the WPK Central Committee.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Unwas greeted on the spot by Ri Hi Yong, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, the chairman of the provincial people's committee, the chief secretary of the Uiju County Party Committee and the chairman of the county people's committee.\nOn a hillock near a bank of the River Amnok overlooking the inundated island of Uiju County, he learned in detail about the specific conditions of the flooded area whose configuration begins to surface, and gave important instructions for rehabilitation.\nHe stressed the need to expand and propel the rehabilitation in a forward-looking and development-oriented way from the viewpoint that the rehabilitation is not only an undertaking for eradicating the aftermath of natural disaster but also a crucial issue of implementing the Party's far-reaching regional development programme.\nCalling for decisively raising the water-passage capacity in order to tackle the chronic vulnerability of the area that turns into a \"reservoir\" in downpour, he instructed the hydraulic engineering and designing sectors to take practical measures after jointly examining in a scientific way the current state of a river bank and the flood-prevention capacity of Uiju County which is bound to suffer flood damage due to the growing water level of the River Amnok.\nSaying that a radical change should be made in building a highly-civilized and fashionable residential district as good as the ones in city, occasioned by the construction of new dwelling houses in Uiju County, he called for building an ideal \"rural cultural city,\" where all amenities related to urban management, ranging from the supply of electricity and drinking water to sewage disposal, are perfectly provided.\nThen, he visited tents being used by flood victims as temporary dwellings and warmly consoled them.\nThe flood victims, unexpectedly seeingKim Jong Unwho visited their quarters in sweltering weather, broke into cheers of \"Hurrah!\" in tears of great excitement.\nThey paid tribute to him out of grateful feelings, looking up in tears to the father of a large socialist family, who had driven his way through rough waters to visit the flood-stricken areas and stayed there for a long time to rescue all of them from critical danger some days before, and even visited the tents where they live to show paternal affection that day.\nSitting knee to knee with flood victims,Kim Jong Untook meticulous care of their living, warmly asking them whether they had something inconvenient, how their meals were provided and if there were any ill persons.\nThey replied that they have nothing inconvenient as all necessary amenities have been provided thanks to his boundless love and the whole country renders all-out assistance, expressing in an excited tone their single desire to live up to his great benevolence.\nTelling them that it would be so hard for them to live away from home, he called on them to endure such pain a little more until the day when a paradise will be built on the ruins left by the natural disaster to provide them with a better life. He thanked them for invariably believing in our Party, saying rehabilitation doesn't matter as there exists such deep trust.\nFeeding children with confectionary he personally brought and putting lovely clothes on them, he said that seeing children he felt really encouraged and more deeply awakened to the sense of the duty he assumed to make the country stronger for the rising generations.\nFeeling the warm parental affection by the fatherly leader, who talked with them for a long time despite sultry weather, warmly taking their hands to console them and redouble their confidence and courage, flood victims hardly repressed their great emotion and thrust themselves into his embrace, raising stormy cheers in tears.\nFlood victims followed him step by step, reluctant to part from him. Telling them to go back, he promised to visit them again the next day\nHe met flood victims of Uiju County again on August 9 to clarify our Party and government's stand related to rehabilitation, take crucial measures and console them.\nHe made sure that aid materials prepared by the Party Central Committee for the flood victims of Sinuiju City and Uiju County were conveyed to them by his private train.\nHe also authorized the members of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee to convey the aid materials to the flood victims in Jagang and Ryanggang provinces on the spot.\nCadres of the Party Central Committee handed over the aid materials to the flood victims.\nThe flood victims of Uiju County, who received the aid materials associated with his warm care, raised loud cheers of \"Hurrah!\" in floods of tears, overwhelmed by deep gratitude, great happiness and high excitement.\nKim Jong Unshowed warm parental care for children, warmly hugging them in new clothes, caressing their hair and talking with them in whispers.\nHe made a consolatory speech before the flood victims.\nNoting that he came again to acquaint himself in more detail about their living conditions on the spot, reassign a series of tasks related to the recovery work and take crucial state measures helpful to the victims in addition, he said that he felt much relieved and greatly encouraged to see all of them living in good health without any inconvenience.\nPointing out that the people constitute the foundation and pillar of the Party and the state, the starting point and the focus of all their activities, he said that he takes pride in the people absolutely and unconditionally believing in the Party and the government even in the period of disaster-brought hardship. He told them about the important measures to be taken, clarifying the stand of the Party and the government on the issue of promoting the flood victims' living and rehabilitation.\nRecalling that the Party and the state concentrate their efforts on the rehabilitation campaign, he said that strong construction forces, including service personnel of the People's Army and young people, had already been deployed and transport of rehabilitation materials is underway under an emergency system.\nThe most urgent issue, arising in the period of two or three months until the housing construction is completed and their living stabilized, is the one of life and education of children and students, he said, adding that childcare, edification and education are the primary state affairs never to be given up in any emergency situation.\nHe announced such an important measure as putting into operation an emergency system to bring all the children and students in the families of flood victims in North Phyongan, Jagang and Ryanggang provinces to Pyongyang to take educational care of them in a secure and convenient environment at the expenses of the state and in its direct charge until the rehabilitation finishes, and rendering state-backed protection and care to the old and sick persons, honoured disabled soldiers and baby mums after bringing them to Pyongyang.\nHe said that he leaves everything to individual intentions and decisions of the flood victims for there may be different personal problems but the above-said measure is to be taken as a top priority of the state so the Party and the government will take full charge and care of the health and life of the flood victims who will come to Pyongyang in the sincerest manner and do their best to that end.\nNoting that the enemies persist in their foolish attempt to abuse the flood damage suffered by us as a chance for tarnishing the image of our state, he denounced the enemies on the strongest rhetorical terms, branding their fabrications as a smear campaign and a grave provocation against the DPRK and an insult to the flood-stricken people who are all safe and well.\nThere is no need to make educational materials exclusively as such a stark fact serves as good educational materials for giving a clear understanding of what a disgusting clan the enemies are, what an extremely anachronistic mode they have employed in their fabrications and politically-motivated false propaganda, what a black-hearted intention lurks behind it, and why we call them enemies and human scum, he stressed.\nNoting that we are facing a very important task to prevent natural disasters, which is more serious and urgent than the on-going large-scale rehabilitation, he set forth the tasks and ways for building nationwide disaster-prevention capabilities, including the issue of establishing a rapid and orderly weather forecast system for proactively controlling the factors vulnerable to natural disasters, and the issue of setting up an integrated water control system in all units in charge of managing power stations and dams, in particular.\nExpressing thanks to various foreign countries and international organizations for their offer of humanitarian support, he said what we regard as the best in all realms and processes of state affairs is the firm trust in the people and the way of tackling problems thoroughly based on self-reliance.   Our Party Central Committee and government will depend entirely on the patriotic enthusiasm and courage of our people and the potentialities of our country in the ongoing rehabilitation, too, he added.\nReferring to the fact that the DPRK has taken sure advantage in the ongoing rehabilitation by dint of nationwide concentration and all-people mobilization, he solemnly declared that our Party and government will readily brave any challenges to accomplish without fail the tasks of the times, the historic tasks which they decided and shouldered of their own accord for our great people and future, and surely live up to the people's trust with faithful service and good results.\nThe undying story, in whichKim Jong Unvisited the flood-stricken people again to console and encourage them and take important state measures repeatedly for stabilizing their living and successfully carrying out the rehabilitation, will be recorded in history as another legendary tale about his paternal love for the people to be etched in the great father's journey of devoted service, and as a significant event that adds vitality to the drive of the people all out in response to the Party's call, proving once again that the programme and policies of the WPK and the DPRK government are based on the people-first doctrine. -0-",

I feel very grateful for and proud of it.\nAnd I realize more keenly what should I do more and how for these laudable people, who steadfastly follow our Party devoting their pure loyalty and a sense of obligation throughout their life.\nWhat I would like to mention first here is that the Central Committee of our Party and the government of our Republic will always share with you your pains caused by the disaster.\nThe people are the foundation and pillars of our Party and state and the starting point and focus of their all activities.\nGoing closer to the people to share their feelings the harder the times are is the mode of existence and activities inherent to our Party.\nThe place where the leadership of our state should find itself at a time when the people suffered disaster like this is the disaster-stricken area and rehabilitation project site.\nExtending once again profound consolation to you, I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to outline the immediate measures our Party and government will take to promote the living of the flood victims and repair the damage.\nAll work of the Party and the state are now concentrated on the rehabilitation campaign here.\nNot only here but also some areas in Jagang and Ryanggang provinces in the basin of the Amnok River suffered damage.\nIn order to finish the campaign in the shortest period possible on the highest level, the Party and the government have decided to make a readjustment of even some of the construction projects of national importance and commit colossal human and material resources to the campaign.\nFor us today, nothing is more important and urgent than to stabilize the living of the flood victims and take permanent safety measures to prevent any recurrence of flooding.\nAs a preliminary to the enforcement of effective measures for fully restoring the flood victims\u2019 living conditions as soon as possible and removing the aftermath of the natural calamity, a comprehensive and detailed investigation about the damage is ongoing, and the relevant sector is striving hard to draw up a scientific plan for the restoration project.\nA more than 130 000-strong construction workforce comprising service personnel of the People\u2019s Army and young people is being committed for the restoration work here in North Phyongan Province alone.\nAt the national level, the Central Committee on Measures for Repairing the Damage was organized and has commenced its work, to be followed by provincial on-site headquarters for the restoration work; and the transportation of necessary materials has already been switched over to an emergency system.\nOur objective in displaying such daring spirit, organizing work at lightning speed and seeking its unfailing implementation is to transform your dear island villages and the northwestern part of the country beyond recognition.\nComrades,\nThe whole country is all out for the restoration work, but given the extent of damage, it will take at least two or three months to stabilize the flood victims\u2019 living by building new houses and repairing the existing ones.\nWhat the Party and the government should give top priority to in this period is to take good care of their living as much as possible.\nRecently, I am holding consultations every day with leading officials of the relevant institutions over the necessary measures to be adopted to this end.\nIt is indispensable to set up a well-regulated system for the distribution of newspapers and other publications, supply a TV set to each family and install one in every public place, so that the afflicted residents can keep abreast of the Party\u2019s intentions, and to direct close attention to ensuring them a good meal.\nThe biggest bottleneck in the flood-stricken areas is the living and teaching for students and other children.\nCurrently, some leading officials within our government, for their lack of experience and qualifications, are making a point of the restoration work in total disregard of educating and caring for students and other children.\nNeedless to say, children will find it quite inconvenient to live in tents or others\u2019 houses until the completion of the restoration work, and, in particular, this will have a serious impact on their education.\nAlso, measures for medical care are not going beyond the supply of medicines, and there is not yet a specific and realistic plan for medical services.\nWith regard to this, I criticized the officials concerned at yesterday\u2019s consultative meeting with the relevant departments of the Party Central Committee.\nSo, we are going to put in place an emergency system, whereby during the restoration work the students and all other children of the afflicted families in North Phyongan, Jagang and Ryanggang provinces shall stay in Pyongyang and be provided with a safe and comfortable environment for care and education, entirely at state expense.\nNursing, edification and education of students and other children are the most important of all state affairs never to be abandoned even if the sky may fall in.\nSo, the state is going to take full responsibility for this work during the rehabilitation campaign period.\nAnd state-backed care benefits will be offered in Pyongyang to the elderly and sick persons, honoured disabled ex-soldiers and nursing mothers before new houses are built in the flood-stricken areas.\nAccording to a rough estimate,\u00a0among the families of flood victims preschoolers number 2 198, students 4 384, the elderly 4 524, the sick and the honoured disabled ex-soldiers 265, and nursing mothers 4 096.\nThen, the number of flood victims who will be brought to Pyongyang will total over 15 400.\nWith a view to giving such a state emergency assistance, the Party Central Committee will organize a command team and ensure that services for them are offered at the April 25 Hostel and the military parade training base in Pyongyang.\nIt will provide temporary learning spaces for students and other children and organize interim mobile educational teams, comprising teachers from primary and middle schools and preschool educational institutions in Pyongyang. They will give education without letup to the students and other children after their summer vacation is over.\nIt will also ensure that staple and subsidiary foods, daily necessities and medicines are fully supplied, and mobile service and medical teams are organized with competent members from the important service units and hospitals in Pyongyang so as to direct all efforts to ensuring the living conditions of flood victims according to the state\u2019s special measures.\nThere might be some mothers who are reluctant to be separated from their little children for several months, and there might be some persons who are unwilling to leave for some reasons, I think.\nAs there may be their personal reasons, I will leave it to their intentions and decisions.\nHowever, this was organized to do even one more thing helpful to the flood victims suffering in the unfamiliar areas and minimize their inconveniences, you may rest assured of me, I think.\nAs it is the top priority work of the state, the Party and the government will take full responsibility for caring with utmost sincerity the health and living of the flood victims coming to Pyongyang as their parents and children would do, and make special and devoted efforts lest all of them feel an iota of gloom.\nIt is another problem facing the families evacuated from the areas, which are undergoing rehabilitation, that they have no proper places to keep their family property even if they manage to get them out of water.\nThe flood victims do not show any signs of it, but they might feel great anxiety.\nSo for the convenience of the evacuated families during the construction of new houses, we should offer them places where they can keep their household belongings safely.\nThis will also be good for the families to be enjoying protection and care in Pyongyang.\nComrades,\nIt is necessary for us to impress on our mind once again that the current rehabilitation project is not simply an undertaking for our own but also a serious struggle against the enemy.\nAt present, the enemy, misusing the occasion when we have suffered damage, is continuing to make foolish attempts to tarnish the image of our state.\nIt is important to inform Party organizations and working people\u2019s organizations at all levels, various networks of education and the people of these facts and thus make them have a correct understanding of the ROK scum bordering on us.\nThe rubbish ROK\u2019s media are desperately slandering all the socialist benefits and measures taken by our Party and government for the flood victims and also the communist traits displayed throughout the society, abusing them as a means of achieving some sort of internal unity and a type of demonstration. They are also fabricating such false information, in their frantic manoeuvres to slander our government and system, that the missing persons in the afflicted areas exceed 1 000 in number and that its intelligence authorities found out that several helicopters had fallen on rescue mission.\nWorse still, they are spreading a baseless rumour that the V-day celebrations took place in Pyongyang on the 27th of last month when loss of life occurred in the flood-hit areas.\nBecause the rumour is in wide circulation in the ROK society that its government is always late in coping with all sorts of accidents that happened there and such is an everyday occurrence in the country, they seem to weave absurd sophistry that slanders and slights us in an attempt to coax their citizens and stir up world public sentiments.\nWhen I visited the helicopter unit that rescued you, I gave full account of the rescue operation, including the crash-landing by one helicopter during the operation, and expressed my gratitude that there had been no casualties in the turmoil.\nThe enemy even went so far as to say that I reacted personally to the report fabricated by their media because there were heavy casualties and I intended to cover it up.\nWhat is their dogged insistence on making you, safe and sound like this, missing or dead? It is an open and shut case.\nThis is a smear campaign and a grave provocation against our state as well as an insult to you.\nI have reason and feel it necessary to say this about the media of the dirty, rubbish country.\nThere is no need for us to make separate materials for education. It is because these clear facts are actual and educational materials good enough to clearly bring home to the people how filthy the enemy clan is, what ancient and old-fashioned way they resort to for fabrication and political smear campaign to tarnish the image of our state, what their ulterior motives are and why we call the enemy the enemy and scum.\nNo country in the world has such media which does nothing but to invent groundless and exaggerated lies.\nWhat we must clearly realize is that the enemy is what we see them now.\nReferring to these actual facts, the whole country should have a correct understanding of the enemy and cultivate a correct feeling against them.\nOur enemy is an unchangeable enemy.\nWe should make the current opportunity, which helps us to have a correct understanding of what our enemy is, an opportunity of having a correct stand towards the enemy.\nToday, present here are leading officials of Party organizations and government organs of North Phyongan Province, as well as officials of Uiju County.\nI would like to take this opportunity to dwell on the tasks of regional Party organizations and government organs for stabilizing the living of flood victims and repairing the damage in the disaster-stricken areas.\nThe masters of relevant areas should play their proper role in the effort to stabilize the living of the flood victims at the earliest possible date.\nAs you have witnessed, many flood victims in different areas including North Phyongan and Jagang provinces are living outdoors in the violent heat and sultry weather.\nOf course, we built houses for the people without fail in the past, however many of them were destroyed, and now the flood victims in the afflicted areas are living optimistically, placing their trust in our Party.\nEven so, local Party organizations and government organs should never make light of the fact that there are people who have been left homeless and are living in tents.\nThey should ensure that food, non-staple foodstuffs and fuel indispensable for their living are supplied regularly without running short of them, and take strong measures to supply them with daily necessities.\nProvinces, cities and counties should promote the flood victims\u2019 living by providing them in a responsible manner with the food and other materials in need with those in reserve and promptly supplying them with relief materials of the state.\nThey should supply the flood victims with all daily necessities, ranging from bedding, sanitation goods to such small articles as scissors, needles and threads.\nThey should direct close attention to the supply of drinking water.\nWater is one of the basic essentials for people\u2019s living, and drinking water is badly needed in the flood-hit areas where there are scarce sources of it owing to pollution caused by flood damage.\nParty organizations and power organs in the relevant areas should do away with a temporary attitude, and take effective steps for supplying enough drinking water to places where the flood victims live.\nPublic health and epidemic prevention are the most vulnerable sectors in the afflicted areas.\nWherever the flood victims have been evacuated, it is necessary, by taking their number into account, to properly install bathrooms, public toilets, garbage dumps and drain pipes in conformity with hygienic standards and effectively maintain them, so as to eliminate the sources of outbreak of epidemic diseases.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should commit all medical resources available in the areas to taking good care of the victims\u2019 health in a responsible manner, supply them with Koryo and other medicines to the utmost, and conduct an epidemic prevention campaign in an intensive way.\nThey should be proactive in organizing and conducting the rehabilitation project to restore the production and living order in the flood-hit areas to the normal level.\nThey should strictly conduct a safety test of the afflicted dwelling houses and public buildings, and on the basis of this, promptly launch the rehabilitation project.\nA key factor in this regard is to check such details as whether the buildings, which were submerged, have not undergone structural changes and whether their foundations are firm enough, and thoroughgoing measures should be adopted for preventing second damage due to the collapse of those buildings.\nAnother important factor is to distinguish what should be newly built from what are in need of repair, introduce a scientific order of priority and plans for the restoration work, and give priority to the construction and repair of houses so that the flood victims can move into them as soon as possible.\nIn addition, the socio-economic life in the afflicted areas should be put back on a normal track at the earliest possible date by vigorously pushing forward the rehabilitation of the damaged public buildings and industrial facilities including schools, kindergartens, hospitals, factories and enterprises.\nThe designing and construction of dams in the afflicted areas should be done in a scientific way, based on a comprehensive and detailed survey of the local physiographical conditions and embankments. In particular, it is important in designing the dams to make an accurate estimate of the conditions at the time of the highest level of water, and, wherever necessary, to install flood-blocking structures.\nAs things stand at the moment, our regions are unilaterally vulnerable to the rising level of water flowing into the Amnok River. This time we should decisively remove this chronic vulnerability, thus totally eliminating the source of risk of flood wreaking havoc on Uiju County and the city of Sinuiju on the lower reaches of the river.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should adopt prompt measures for restoring the major elements of infrastructure in the afflicted areas, such as roads, railways, communications and power grids.\nEnsuring free traffic flow is a pressing task, since it is a prerequisite for the transport of manpower, equipment and materials to the rehabilitation sites and for the residents\u2019 free economic activities. So, it is urgent to open the roads and railways in cooperation with the People\u2019s Army units that have been seconded to the rehabilitation project. Efforts should also be focused on restoring communications and the power grids to meet the needs of the local residents and the rehabilitation project for communication and electricity at the earliest possible date.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should work in a responsible manner to recover damage that has been done to the agricultural sector.\nThis time not a few hectares of crop fields were inundated; they should not give up or feel disheartened, but make redoubled efforts to prevent the spread of damage.\nThey should learn a lesson from the fact that the key aspect of damage is the most of the crop fields being submerged. They should identify the weak spots in the dams, river embankments and waterways, and take thoroughgoing steps for repairing and reinforcing them immediately, while adopting scientific and technological measures for improving the growth of crops in the afflicted fields.\nBased on a detailed analysis of the pumping stations for drainage, they should double their capacity to keep farmland from being damaged by any possible flood, and provide a firm scientific and technical guarantee for their regular operation at full capacity.\nThey should focus on the political work aimed at instilling confidence in the junior officials of the farms and other farmers and mobilizing them, giving effective and responsible guidance over the work of repairing the damage done to the crops.\nThey should also give a strong impetus to restoring the arable land that has been buried or washed away.\nComrades,\nWe are currently facing a crucial task of disaster prevention, which is no less important and which is much more serious and urgent, than the huge rehabilitation project.\nRecently, the extent of damage caused by disastrous weather conditions is increasing worldwide year after year, and in actual fact, no part of our country is absolutely safe, i.e., insusceptible to flooding and typhoon.\nThis being the case, some officials neglect the disaster prevention work, arguing on their regional characteristics or browsing through meteorological observation records. Such is a very dangerous and unpardonable act which is tantamount to gambling with people\u2019s safety.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should stake their future development on the prevention of recurrence of damage by disastrous weather conditions, putting themselves on tenterhooks and making redoubled efforts to preclude any more disastrous consequences.\nFor the present, they should set up a prompt and well-knit weather forecasting system and establish the discipline, order and system whereby all the sectors and units in their respective regions respond effectively to any disastrous weather conditions. In this way, they can keep themselves from being affected by the expected heavy rain and typhoon.\nDamage caused by the recent flood highlighted how important it is in the prevention of disasters to ensure close contact and cooperation among various sectors and regions.\nIn case of emergency regions should maintain close contacts, promptly informing one another of what elements are at risk and actively regulating and adjusting their responses. In particular, when heavy rain or flooding is imminent, all the units responsible for maintaining power stations and reservoir dams should absolutely obey the directives from the central organ that is in charge of the unified system for water control.\nIt is important for the state to renew its water control system and create a specialized institution in order to establish an integrated water control system for enforcing, adjusting and implementing a uniform water control policy, which will tackle various tasks facing regions, ranging from the supply of drinking water to responses to flooding, drought and other disasters.\nThe lesson taught by the recent flood damage has proved that our pressing task is to make the organs in charge of maintaining the dams enhance their role, and to ensure their integrated coordination and put it on a scientific footing quickly.\nHowever, the existing disaster prevention organs are lame-duck entities substituting their assignment for collecting statistics.\nThis offers a glimpse of our officials\u2019 irresponsible work style, and if they stick to their stereotypical way of thinking and formalistic work methods, such disaster prevention organs, however many, will bring no benefit to the state.\nIt is advisable to study the issues of setting a flood warning period in the rainy season, ensuring unified and coordinated management of the sectoral and regional units in charge of water control, and putting a flood response system in place.\nAlong with this, an integrated flood forecast system should be established in a more scientific way.\nAs I have already stressed, any lax approach of failing to consider the worst conditions in construction will inevitably invite a terrible disaster.\nWe should build new, excellent houses where geographical safety against disaster is assured and perfect measures have been adopted for disaster prevention, so that they will last for the coming 50 to 100 years.\nTo this end, appropriate sites of construction should be fixed with their safety assessment as a major criterion; a proper plan for the distribution and layout of houses should be drawn up to provide every convenience for the residents and satisfy their demands; and the durability of houses should be ensured by increasing the amount of building materials needed for each house and encouraging the builders to enhance their sense of responsibility.\nWhat is no less important than to ensure high speed and good quality in the construction of houses is to sustain their modernity commensurate with the increased level of civilization of our people.\nThe designing and construction of houses should be done in a non-repetitive, diversified and unique style so they can meet the modern tastes and preserve the characteristic features of the given regions and villages.\nI want to specially emphasize that there should be no wrong practice of demolishing the existing houses and building new ones on their very sites in a perfunctory manner without an accurate calculation.\nIt is also important to give the residents regular education on how to cope with disasters.\nWe should work effectively to heighten their consciousness of coping with disasters; define, on the basis of a detailed survey and confirmation, the spots where the residents are to take shelter in case of disaster, and work out guidelines for their evacuation; and give a strong impetus to securing essential means of rescue operation to be used in various emergency circumstances.\nAll the regions should conduct a comprehensive review and investigation of their capabilities to prevent natural calamities, discover the weak points and adopt timely measures for reinforcing them. Also, in anticipation of the worst situation caused by torrential rain, flooding, typhoon and tidal waves, they should identify, eradicate and take precautions against dangerous spots, while paying due attention to ensuring effective afforestation and water conservation.\nComrades,\nThe enormous undertakings for the repairing of the damage, which constitutes a big step in the course of alleviating the people's pain, providing them with greater welfare and transforming the regions, make a particularly high demand on the officials of the field Party and government organs.\nAll the officials should display the spirit of sincerely and devotedly assisting the people in the afflicted areas and sharing joy and sorrow with them.\nThe respect for and devoted service to the people are the inherent duty and obligation of our officials, and when the people suffer hardship, they should especially be faithful to their own duty.\nIn particular, all the Party officials should go deep among the masses to strengthen ties with them and, in the course of this, get fused into a harmonious whole with them to inspire them to the rehabilitation campaign.\nLast, I would like to emphasize the need to prevent any deviation in the assistance to the people in the afflicted areas.\nAt present, all parts of the country, as well as the Party Central Committee, the Cabinet, ministries and national agencies, are rendering assistance to the flood victims.\nAssistance work must be conducted strictly on the principle of voluntariness, never in an organized or forced way.\nIn the past, when such natural disasters as flooding occurred, institutions, enterprises and working people\u2019s organizations revealed such practices as pointing out the variety and quantity of relief supplies to collect them, while cadres, prompted by the desire for personal fame, subjectively gave assignments for assistance work to gather materials and send them.\nWe must not get our people to send aid even by imposing burdens on them on the pretext that they do not make any complaints, regarding it as their natural duty to help the residents in the afflicted areas.\nSuch assistance is worse than not offering at all.\nIt is needed to intensify the grasp and guidance over the whole society in order to make sure that the assistance work for the people in the afflicted areas is done on the principle of voluntariness, strictly in accordance with the will of each person, so that this work becomes a process in which our society\u2019s great traits of sharing pain and sorrow and helping and leading one another forward are truthfully manifested in name and reality.\nAt the same time, it is necessary to grasp and register aid funds and materials in a unified way and distribute and supply them in a fair and rational way, so that they can be used effectively for the stabilization of the living of the flood victims and the damage recovery, while imposing strict control lest there should appear such undesirable practices as fame seeking, misappropriation and fraud.\nAt present, many countries and international organizations are expressing their willingness to provide us with humanitarian assistance.\nI extend thanks to them.\nBut what we put forward first in all domains and processes of the state affairs is the way of addressing problems by relying on the firm trust in the people and entirely on our own efforts.\nWhat the Party Central Committee and the government relies on in the current rehabilitation campaign is also the patriotic enthusiasm and valour of our people and the potentials of our state from A to Z.\nAs we have always done, we will value our confidence in our own strength more than anything else, solve all problems by enlisting the strength and wisdom of the people, and continue to steadily expand and increase our state\u2019s strength in that way to shape our future with our own strength and efforts in the future, too.\nAs all the national efforts are concentrated on the rehabilitation project and all the planned work is being smoothly pushed forward under the unified and powerful guidance of our government, we will, by and large, remain consistent in this principle.\nComrades,\nNationwide concentration and all-people mobilization\u2013these have given us a good chance of sure victory in the repairing of the disaster.\nIn order to accomplish the tasks of the times, the historic tasks on which we decided and which we have shouldered by ourselves for our beloved people and our future, the Party and the government will readily brave any challenges and live up to the people\u2019s trust with their faithful service and excellent results.\nWe will serve the people faithfully.\nAnd we will always be with you.\nDear inhabitants of Uiju County and the city of Sinuiju,\nDear inhabitants of the afflicted areas in Jagang and Ryanggang provinces,\nPlease inform us open-heartedly through the relevant Party organizations at any time if you feel any inconveniences or difficulties.\nPlease wait for the day when you will lead a new life in your living place which will be changed more splendidly.\nAnd I wish you good health free from illnesses.\nLet all of us pool our strength to successfully overcome the present crisis and get up.\nLong live our great people! -0-",
