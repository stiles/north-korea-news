        "story_text":"Pyongyang, December 24 (KCNA) -- Japan continues discharging nuclear-contaminated water into sea, endangering the lives and security of all mankind.\nThe Japanese authorities recently announced its plan to begin the fourth-round discharge of nuclear-polluted water into sea next February.\nThe point is that they decided not to confirm the amount of tritium in the water this time though such process had been gone through for the mere form's sake.\nJapan, which finally started the discharge of nuclear-polluted water in disregard of serious concern and uneasiness of the international community, hyping it as \"clean and treated water\", is going to release the water into sea without going through the process of identifying the amount of radioactive materials. This is just an unpardonable rash behavior of making a mockery of human life.\nThe world public still remembers the unheard-of terrible crimes Japan committed during the Second World War by organizing secret germ-warfare units like Unit 731 and Unit 516 to frantically speed up the research and production of various bio-chemical weapons and reducing Koreans and other Asian people to guinea pigs for confirming their feasibility.\nToday the descendants of the germ-warfare criminals ill-famed for inflicting untold pain and misfortune upon regional people are exposing the life and security of all mankind on Earth to serious danger by contaminating the sea, common wealth of mankind, with radioactive water.\nNo wonder, huge piles of dead sardines washed ashore in Japan in October and in December became a hot topic of world media.\nCommenting on such worrisome phenomena, foreign media described the scene as \"fish waves.\"\nRecalling that the phenomena happened three months after the discharge of radioactive water into sea off Fukushima, Daily Mail reported that this casts the suspicion that Japan's discharge of nuclear-polluted water affected the ecological system.\nAgainst this backdrop, there is a widespread public opinion in China believing that sardines were killed by nuclear contamination and deploring that Japan's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water will soon exterminate mankind.\nBut Japan has gone so far as to say \"there is no problem in safety\", impudently citing \"tolerable limit.\"\nThere is no smoke without fire.\nJapan's discharge of nuclear-polluted water is not the one merely concerning some countries and region but a high-profile hideous crime that seriously threatens all countries and regions in the world and even the distant future of mankind.\nJapan, defying the unanimous voice of the international community and mocking human life, can never evade its responsibility for the heinous crime. -0-",

And in February the following year, it seized another tanker in the waters off the United Arab Emirates, asserting that the ship is related to the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps of Iran, and plundered about 2 million barrels of oil and sold it for 110 million U.S. dollars.\nAs regards the recent capture of the U.S. oil tanker, Iran said that its action is a part of the retaliation against the U.S. oil-plundering act, declaring that \"the days when the U.S. stole oil and ran away has gone and we will not allow the U.S. to threaten our country in the region.\"\nIt is a deserved punishment for the U.S., the kingpin of modern-day \"pirate\" who does not hesitate to commit such heinous crimes as seizing other country's resources in broad daylight, not content with fattening through aggression and plunder.\nThe \"piracy\" by the U.S. is not confined to Iran only.\nAfter being stationed in Syria in a conspiratorial and brigandish way, the U.S. has stretched its tentacles of robbery not only to oil but also to grain, cotton and other agricultural products.\nEarly in January 2023, it plundered oil and wheat by mobilizing 60 tankers and trucks, and in December alone, stole a large amount of oil and food twice from Syria which suffered from earthquake damage.\nThe U.S., engrossed in plundering and robbery in different parts of the world, has disgraced itself from the outset of the year.\nIt is quite natural that the despicable plunder by the gangster-like U.S. is punished by justice. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The following is the KCNA commentary titled \"Fascist violence that insulted the Korean victims of forcible drafting in denial of past crimes\":\nShortly ago, the Gunma prefectural authorities of Japan committed such fascist violence as forcibly removing a memorial monument to the Korean victims of forcible drafting.\nThe monument, erected in the Gunma Prefectural Park in April 2004 in the hope that Japanese would always remember and repent of the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the past and promote peace in Asia and friendship between the DPRK and Japan, has been a symbol of the lessons of history for nearly 20 years.\nHowever, the prefectural authorities turned down the renewal of the licence for the monument and decided on its removal, terming the phrase \"forcible drafting,\" mentioned at the memorial service held in front of the monument in 2012, \"loss of political neutrality\" and \"act running counter to its establishment purpose\".\nThe Gunma prefectural authorities had been impossible to attain their goal due to the fierce protests by the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and Japanese civic and social circles. This year they finally removed the monument in such a forcible way as \"administrative execution\".\nThis is a base act of denying the past crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists, who inflicted untold pain and misfortune upon Korea and many other countries and nations in Asia, and beautifying their colonial rule over them. It is an unpardonable unethical act of reopening the old wounds among the direct victims of forcible drafting and their descendants.\nJapan can never cover up the forcible drafting and forced labor it committed against the Korean people in the last century.\nIn order to forcibly mobilize human and material resources needed for the war of aggression on April 1, 1938, the Japanese imperialists promulgated the \"National Mobilization Law\" containing the gangster-like paragraph - \"the enactment of the current law applies to external territories (colonies).\" They also instituted or revised such evil laws as \"Ordinance on Labor Conscription\" and \"the Women's Volunteer Corps Service Ordinance\", thus forcibly drafting and abducting the Korean people into the sites of death, irrespective of their age and sex.\nThousands of forcibly drafted Korean people were forced into slave labor at munitions factories, underground factories, airports, power stations and mines in Gunma Prefecture alone.  Many Koreans lost their lives in the alien land at the end of their harsh labor and miserable life.\nIt is the legal duty and due obligation of the assailant nation to feel sorry for the victims, make reparation for the crimes and prevent the recurrence of such misfortune.\nBut the Gunma prefectural authorities revealed their anti-historical and unethical true colors and wild revanchist ambition through the unreasonable and forcible removal of the memorial monument to the Korean victims of forcible drafting.\nWhat merits a more serious attention is that the Gunma prefectural governor who led and directed the removal is a die-hard ultra-right politician steeped in hostility toward the DPRK to the marrow of his bones, and is in cahoots with the behind-the-scene forces working hard to remove the monument to the Korean victims of the great Kanto quake in Tokyo and other similar monuments across the Japanese archipelago.\nTo write off the past history is meant to repeat it.\nChongryon, Koreans in Japan and Japanese political parties and social organizations are now waging a dynamic struggle demanding the restoration of the monument, resolutely denouncing the unreasonable violence.\nThe Gunma prefectural authorities should ponder over the consequences to be entailed by the present situation which sparked off great anger at home and abroad and restore the memorial monument at once.\nThey can never evade the responsibility for the fascist violence. -0-",

Therefore, it is just as expected.\nThe foolish \"human rights\" conspiratorial racket, which has nothing to do with ensuring genuine human rights, will not work on the DPRK.\nBut there is a need to take this opportunity.\nThe most urgent issue facing the international community in the field of human rights is the protection of the rights to existence of inhabitants in the Gaza Strip exposed to mass killings.\nSince the armed clash between the Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine (Hamas) and Israel broke out in October last year, tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians have been killed and one million and hundreds of thousand of refugees in Rafah City, the southern city of Gaza, are exposed to death threats.\nIn particular, many Palestinian children have been killed or have become orphans and disabled. Even elementary right to existence is violated, far from the right to education and healthcare. This miserable reality arouses serious concern of the international community.\nEven politicians of the Western countries, pro-U.S. and pro-Israeli ones, admit that human casualties and humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip have already reached an \"intolerable\" phase, urging an urgent investigation into whether Israel has observed international law on human rights and relevant treaties.\nHowever, the U.S., often taking issue with the \"human rights situation\" of other countries and styling itself \"human rights judge\", is keeping mum about it.\nThe world is watching once again the shameless behavior of the U.S., asking why the \"human rights champion\", which used to cry out for adopting human rights resolutions, imposing sanctions on some countries with faked-up data and referring the issue to the International Court of Justice, is keeping mum about the thrice-cursed human rights abuses committed by Israel.\nWhere does the United States focus its attention?\nThere is no more obvious answer than the fact.\nThe U.S. is seeking to divert the attention of the international community by orchestrating the visit by its \"special envoy for human rights\", while feigning ignorance about the terrible human rights situation in the Gaza Strip. This clearly proves that the attention of the \"human rights judge\" is not focused on the protection of genuine human rights.\nThe U.S. seeks to tarnish the image of the anti-imperialist independent countries, which are opposed to its high-handed and arbitrary practices, under the pretext of \"human rights issue\", alienate their governments from people and finally overthrow their social systems.\nThe alternative and double-dealing American-style \"human rights\" are the means for implementing the hegemonic policy and for aggression and interference in internal affairs as such standards and countermeasures change according to whether the targets are pro-U.S. or anti-U.S.\nThe present reality, in which human rights cannot be protected if the sovereignty of the state is violated, clearly proves that the DPRK's claim - human rights precisely means the sovereignty - is entirely just.\nIf the DPRK had not defended the sovereignty of the state and firmly bolstered up its capabilities for self-defence, it would have suffered the same misfortune as the Palestinians.\nHuman rights not guaranteed by the sovereignty and strength of the state are just like building a castle on the sand. If the sovereignty is weak and the sovereignty is not defended, it is impossible to guarantee elementary right to existence, to say nothing of the dignity and development of individuals. This is a bitter lesson taught by the present world.\nWe will resolutely foil the U.S. and riff-raffs' \"human rights\" racket, regarding it as a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and the most grave challenge to its existence and development, and defend the inviolable sovereignty and genuine human rights in the future, too.\nThe special envoy for \"human rights\", engrossed in the \"human rights smear campaign against the DPRK\", had better visit the Middle East, if he or she is not a political maid of the White House but a true \"human rights champion.\" Then the envoy may get \"actual results.\" -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- The UN Security Council on Feb. 20 put a resolution reflecting the world public opinion to resolutely check Israel's massacre of Palestinians to a vote, but only the U.S. exercised the veto to make the vote finally end in a failure.\nThis brought to light the hypocritical behavior of the U.S. which has gone so shameless as to stage a double-dealing farce after driving the Middle East region to the vortex of horrible war. And it sparked off bitterer curse and denunciation of the international community.\nFrom the outset of the year the U.S. secretary of State made a busy tour of Middle East countries to try to gain attention as if he was interested in peace, saying that it is necessary to prevent the vicious cycle of violence and protect civilians. And even Biden let loose a string of rhetoric about the \"ceasefire\", stunning the world people.\nShortly ago, the White House announced that Biden held a phone conversation with the Israeli prime minister and called for taking \"immediate and detailed measures\" to expand the thorough and sustained humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip.\nThe U.S. is behaving like a faithful \"apostle of peace\". One reason of such behavior is to clam down the international community's anger at Israel's massacre of Palestinian civilians. But it is nothing but a trick to relieve itself of the concern about the possibility of getting totally isolated and rejected due to its pro-Israel one-sided policy.\nThe U.S., from a historical point of view, has zealously shielded and encouraged the Zionists' moves for territorial expansion, regarding Israel as a shock brigade in realizing its strategy for dominating Middle East and has put them forward as its stooges to increase the regional chaos and instability.\nAfter the conflict in the Gaza Strip in October last year, the U.S. offered Israel a huge amount of various lethal weapons, claiming that Israel should be fully prepared for self-defense. It also collected sensitive information about the leadership of the Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine (Hamas) and the Gaza Strip and offered it to Israel.\nIsrael clearly said that all its missiles, ammunition, precision guided bombs, planes and bombs are provided by the U.S. and without the U.S., it can never fight this war. Like this, the U.S. is behind the bloody disaster in the Gaza Strip.\nDespite the growing voices of the international community calling for realizing the ceasefire and putting an end to the war, the U.S. has steadily supported Israel's massacre politically and militarily, contrary to its massive propaganda about its \"effort for ceasefire\".\nSome days ago, the U.S. Senate passed a bill on aid of more than 14 billion U.S. dollars to Israel. And the U.S. refused for a third time the resolution on the enforcement of ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, which was recently brought up to the UN Security Council.\nAfter all, the U.S. again suppressed the international community's demand for defusing humanitarian crisis and putting an end to war, thus bringing to light its true colors as a vicious harasser of Middle East peace and a rare murderer before the world people.\nAll the facts clearly prove that the \"efforts for ceasefire\" touted by the U.S. are nothing but \"crocodile's tears\" full of hypocrisy and deception.\nWith nothing can the U.S. cover up its moves to block the peaceful settlement of the crisis and keep inciting Israel to bloodshed. And it can never evade the blame for having plunged the Middle East into bloody massacre and extreme confusion. -0-",

The point is that the international order pursued by the U.S. is grounded in the law of the jungle, \"the logic of power\".\nIt's pretty regrettable that the chief diplomat of a \"superpower\" let out such shameful, nasty remarks at the venue of the international conference dealing with global security issues.\nHowever, it is \"helpful\" that his bullshit once again made the world keenly realize that the \"rules-based international order\" trumpeted by the U.S. is a \"jungle law\" where the strong prey on the weak.\nCommenting on this, the Russian foreign minister said that \"the U.S. is coercing other countries into sharing its 'international system table', or else they will be on the 'menu'\". The Chinese newspaper Global Times reported that \"Washington's current official diplomatic rhetoric emphasizes the so-called 'rules-based international order,' but it is all used as tools to demand, restrain, and accuse others, or to cover up U.S. own hegemonic intentions\".\nAs recognized by public at home and abroad, it is the U.S. that cannot survive without preying on the weak, in view of its origination and existence mode.\nBuilt on the sea of blood of Indians, the U.S. staged over 114 big and small wars of aggression and more than 8 900 military interference actions for over 130 years until World War I, and expanded its territory by over ten times by annexing and subordinating other countries and nations.\nAfter World War II, the U.S. has grown corpulent through many wars and military interference actions in the DPRK, Vietnam, Iraq, Syria and other parts of the world and maintained its privileged position.\nEven in the present century when the unipolar world has been collapsing and a new, multi-polarized international order is being established, the U.S. is persistently pursuing its hegemonic and aggressive mode of existence and foreign policy, being obsessed with \"overconfidence in its own strength\", and is constantly breaking the security and stability of the world.\nThe present Middle East situation which has no sign of solution and goes bad to worse can be explained only by the logic of the animal instinct of the U.S.\nThe New York Times in an article titled \"Understanding the Middle East through the Animal Kingdom\" likened the U.S. going to become the \"king of the Middle East jungle\" to a lion and the Middle East countries to a \"parasitoid wasp\" or \"caterpillars\", and stressed the need for the U.S. to burn the whole jungle to kill the parasitoid wasp.\nHence, clearly proved are the true colors of the U.S. sacrificing the Middle East countries and the whole region for its ambition for domination.\nIn a nutshell, the U.S. is devouring others at the table, some countries and nations in the Middle East including Palestine are on the menu as the \"fish and meat\" and Israel is \"skillfully cooking\" to suit the taste of the U.S.\nThe outlook on the world based on the American-style jungle law and hegemonic foreign policy of the U.S. justifying aggression and war for existence can never be tolerated in the present era of human civilization.\nThe U.S. should no longer be allowed to devour the world at the table. -0-",

This sparked off more criticism and vigilance from the international community.\nAgainst this backdrop, the departed souls of the shrine, which have overheated the Japanese politicians with reinvasion fever, came to play the role of a \"mental education master\" for those responsible for realizing the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" under the command of the former SDF high-ranking officer.\nNamely, it is the reality of Japan that the departed souls of the \"imperial army\", who embarked on the road of aggression and plunder in the last century, are openly \"revived\" by the SDF contaminated by militarist poison - the modern-day \"imperial army\u201d.\nNo matter how hard Japan tries to defend such visits to the shrine calling them \"private visits made of their own free will\" under an avalanche of international protests and accusations, it can never cover up the true purpose of the visit to the shrine aimed at militarizing itself and realizing its revanchist ambition.\nWhether it is \"individual freedom\" or \"private visit\", their appearing at the shrine is an undisguised glorification of the unethical crimes committed by Japan and, moreover, danger is mounting as the reinvasion fanatics of the SDF are taking the lead in fanning up ultra-nationalism in Japanese society.\nJapan is ceaselessly expanding the SDF into an offensive force equipped with ultra-modern military hardware while embellishing its past crimes through the distortion of history and trumpeting about the alleged \"growing threat\" from neighboring countries.\nIt is the ambition of Japan for reinvasion that remains unchanged no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and it is self-evident that mankind will suffer another great calamity when it is overlooked.\nWhoever loves peace should be vigilant against the departed souls of the \"imperial army\" that are \"reviving\" in the dark corner of the shrine. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- Kang Jin Song, an international affairs analyst of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued the following article titled \"What is Washington's scheme to extend the sphere of alliance aimed at\":\nThe U.S. is now intensifying its scheme to expand and strengthen military blocs in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAs known, the U.S.-Britain-Australia tripartite defense authority talks on April 8 made public a joint statement on examining a proposal for promoting cooperation between AUKUS and Japan in the field of ultra-modern technology. And Biden confirmed Japan's participation in AUKUS at the U.S.-Japan summit held in Washington on April 10.\nIt means that the extension of AUKUS and the preferential participation of Japan have become formal.\nThe U.S. defends itself saying that cooperation between AUKUS and Japan is limited to the field related to eight core defense technologies, including artificial intelligence and cyber, and it's not aimed at increasing the number of AUKUS members, but the danger of Japan's participation in AUKUS is making the whole international community tense, not to mention the regional countries.\nIn September 2021, AUKUS was forged as a tripartite security cooperation body involving the United States, Britain and Australia. Since its founding, it has been called a nuclear mine planted in the waters of the Asia-Pacific as \"the Anglo-Saxon nuclear submarine alliance\" for seeking nuclear supremacy in the Asia-Pacific region by detouring the international nuclear non-proliferation system.\nJudging from the fact that the extension of AUKUS has become formal and the first candidate for its membership is Japan, a state of aggression and war criminal which tried to develop nuclear weapons during the Second World War and has covertly beefed up its capability for manufacturing nuclear weapons after the war, this poses a serious problem in terms of security environment of the whole world including the Asia-Pacific region.\nWhen the issue of extending AUKUS appeared on the table, Britain and Australia reportedly took a skeptical view, pointing out that Japan failed to fully protect sensitive information.\nAlthough Canada and New Zealand, members of \"Five Eyes\" - an information-sharing body of Anglo-Saxons - were potential candidates for \"AUKUS+\", Japan has been designated as a candidate member of AUKUS, which is attributable to the U.S. pressure and persistent persuasion, according to experts.\nClear is the intention of the U.S. that persists in involving Japan in AUKUS.\nIt is the sinister intention of the U.S. to make Japan, a vanquished country which revised the \"Pacifist Constitution\" and is making frantic moves to beef up the forces of aggression under the cloak of \"possessing counterattack capability\", obsessed by nationalism, a crewmember of a confrontation ship called AUKUS and put it at the outpost line of the anti-China pressure and push the nuclear minefield in the Asia-Pacific region closer to China.\nMost experts comment that the technical cooperation between AUKUS and Japan, promoted under the control of the U.S., will lead sooner or later to its full membership and to the additional admission of other potential candidate countries.\nThe Biden administration recently held a tripartite summit of the U.S., Japan and the Philippines in the wake of a U.S.-Japan summit to call for the strengthened security cooperation between Manila and Tokyo, and Canberra and Seoul. This is mainly aimed at building double and triple infrastructure for implementing the \"integrated deterrence strategy\" against China by ultimately putting together tools designed for achieving supremacy existing in the Asia-Pacific region in a \"latticed\" way.\nThe reality goes to prove once again that the \"competition accompanied by dialogue\" with China and the \"installation of a guard rail\" in bilateral relations, heard from U.S. public officials, are nothing but deceptive slogans and their thinking and practice are oriented to anti-China confrontation from A to Z.\nOwing to the establishment of a \"small group\" of the U.S. whose arch enemy is China and its ceaseless attempt to expand the group, the Asia-Pacific region, where opportunities and potentials for development are richer than any other region of the world, is turning into a theatre of muscle-flexing and a touch-and-go nuclear minefield, and the ensuing immediate and prospective security burden has been heavily placed on the regional and international community.\nThe peace camp in the region and the rest of the world should heighten vigilance against the reckless moves of Washington to frantically expand its alliance sphere without limits, targeting a certain state. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- Days ago, Prime Minister of Japan Kishida said at a meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives that \"he remains unchanged in his intention to revise the Constitution and that he would go on to make every effort to advance.\"\nIt goes without saying that the real aim sought by Japan in its desperate moves for revising the Constitution is to turn it into a \"country capable of fighting a war\" by revising the \"Pacifist Constitution\" for the worse.\nArticle 9 of the Constitution of Japan enforced since 1947 stipulates that Japan will give up for ever the war started by its state power and the threat of armed forces or the use of armed forces as a means for settling international disputes.\nThe former chief of the Legislation Bureau of the Japanese Cabinet said:\nArticle 9 stipulates that Japan will have no ground, naval and air forces and other war capabilities. In other words, Japan will possess self-defence force not an army.\nThere are two pillars that support the concept of \"self-defence\". One is that the Japan Self-Defence Forces can protect only their own country and not use armed forces abroad. Another one is the \"exclusive defense\" whose important aspect is that the SDF cannot have offensive weapons and it cannot have the capability to directly attack other countries' territories and territorial waters and airspace.\nIn this regard, it can be said that the Constitution has constrained to some extent the revival of Japanese militarism which had inflicted great damage on the peoples of Asian countries, advocating the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\"\nBut today, after a lapse of 77 years since the enforcement of the Constitution, Japan has completely removed the mask of \"peace\" which it had worn for form's sake.\nThe prime minister, referring to the existence of SDF set up as the revising item of the Constitution, stressed that \"it is an important work for showing the international community the will to defend the self-sustenance of the state and peace by putting an end to the theory of the SDF's violating of the Constitution, and making the members of the SDF fulfill their duties with pride\", and thus openly revealed where the purpose of the revision is.\nAs a matter of fact, the Japanese reactionaries have put spurs to turning Japan into a military giant after their defeat in the World War II behind the curtain of \"peace\" such as the \"Pacifist Constitution\", \"era of peace\", \"peaceful development\", \"proactive pacifism\" and \"achieving peace\".\nWith the revision of the \"Japan-U.S. Defence Cooperation Guidelines\" and the adoption of the \"security legislation\", they made it possible to expand the sphere of the SDF's activities, confined to Japan's vicinity, to the whole world and to exercise the \"right to collective self-defence\" under the pretext of military support to its allies.\nThe present Cabinet again revised the national security strategy, set by the Abe regime in 2013. It has approved the \"securing of the capability of attacking enemy base\" and is stepping up the preparation of long-range cruise missiles capable of directly attacking other countries' territories.\nAccording to the 2019-2023 trends in international arms transfers released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden on March 11, Japan purchased 29 fighters from the U.S. and ordered 400 long-range missiles for \"enemy base attack\", thus increasing its import of weapons by 155 percent over that in 2014-2018 to become the world's sixth-ranked importer of weapons.\nThe Japanese government included in the 2024 budget the defence fund, which is 16.9 percent increase over the last year to reach the highest record in history, and formally passed it on March 28.\nAlso, after discarding the principle of banning the export of lethal weapons, the Cabinet meeting decided to allow the export of fighters to the third country.\nIn the final analysis, \"the exclusive defense using defence capability only under attack, the abandonment of the possession of capability of attacking enemy base that means direct attack on other countries' territories, the principle of banning the export of weapons and the maintenance of defence capability that basically constrains defence costs to 1% of GDP\", touted by Japan in the past, have become a lip service.\nAgainst such a background, the Japanese prime minister is crying out for the revision of the Constitution. This is aimed at legalizing the militarization moves for reinvasion ambition in an institutional way by removing even such article of the Constitution which had remained an empty document.\nJapan, which suffered a bitter defeat while pursuing the militarist policy of overseas expansion, is rushing to turn itself into a militarist country and launch overseas expansion, oblivious of it. This is a foolish and reckless behavior of digging its own grave. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- Following is the full text of an article \"Provocation to regional peace and security can never be tolerated\" issued by a military commentator of the DPRK on Friday:\nOn May 16, the U.S. military sent F-22 stealth fighters deployed in Hawaii to the Korean peninsula and staged a \"simulated air battle\" with the Republic of Korea (ROK) for the first time.\nTwo F-22 stealth fighters of the U.S. air force and two F-35A stealth fighters of the ROK air force, involved in the drill, exchanged the roles of attack and defence with each other. The enemy media claim that the drill demonstrated the powerful \"deterrent\" to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\nWithout any explanation, we are well aware of why stealth fighters boasting of the \"world's strongest\" have been introduced.\nThe \"revisit\" of F-22 stealth fighters to the Korean peninsula only after seven months and their first \"simulated air battle\" are another clear proof of the hostile nature of the U.S. which has persistently encroached upon regional countries' rights to security while seeking the showdown of force with the DPRK.\nThe military gangsters of the ROK are now driving the military tension on the Korean peninsula into the extremity, keeping pace with their master's anti-DPRK confrontation scheme.\nIn May alone, the ROK staged the largest-ever drill, allegedly to cope with the DPRK's \"air infiltration\", by mobilizing the ground, naval and air forces, along with \"2024 simultaneous joint drill of military corps\" and \"joint drill for defending islands in the first half of the year\" near the border of the DPRK.\nIt also plans to stage a large-scale air drill involving more than 60 fighters such as F-35A and F-15K from May 17 to 24 and have a talk of special operation commanders with the U.S. at the end of this month so as to discuss \"beheading operation\".\nAll the facts remind us once again that the strengthened military alliance and deployment of strategic assets by the U.S. are the main root of further escalating the military tension and unpredictability in the region.\nThe deployment of F-22 will only precipitate the advent of a situation that the U.S. does not want to see, rather than its military effect.\nThe more frequent \"visit\" by unbidden guest across the ocean will further promote the epochal occasions that help step up the war readiness of the DPRK and, the accumulation of such occasions will be turned into a new strategic phase that the U.S. is afraid of and has to be frightened.\nIt will not be a wise behavior to neglect the bolstering of the force capable of neutralizing the military effect of the U.S. deployment of strategic assets and annihilating the source of provocation and the commanding forces in possible case of emergency, though it is hard to completely contain such deployment, to be continued in the future.\nThe military provocations of the U.S. and the ROK against the DPRK will never escape frustration due to the powerful practical counteraction of the DPRK for defending the national security and regional peace. -0-",

They have nothing to do with the genuine international efforts for the eradication of terrorism.\nIt is a universal truth that intensified \"anti-terrorist efforts\" of the U.S. give rise to the emergence of various terrorist groups and escalated vicious cycle of terrorist attacks and retaliation, far from defusing the danger of terrorism in different parts of the world.\nThat's why the U.S. slogan of \"anti-terrorism\" is now being slandered and rejected by the international community and used internationally as an official term for characterizing Washington's aggressive foreign policy.\nThe U.S. would be well advised to work hard to stop its junior ally in the Middle East in its reckless state-sponsored terrorism, rather than wasting its energy in its foolish act of branding other countries as \"terrorist states\" under the pretext of the \"efforts against terrorism\".\nIt is the consistent stand of the DPRK to resolutely oppose all forms of terrorism threatening international peace and stability.\nBut we remind the U.S. once again that we have neither intention nor interest in cooperation with the U.S. in its \"efforts against terrorism\" exclusively used as a tool for interference and aggression on other sovereign states.\nThe DPRK will continue taking necessary measures to disclose before the international community such interference and acts of aggression openly committed by the U.S. under the signboard of \"cooperation in combating terrorism\" and to thoroughly foil them. -0-",

It has frequently put into operation the \"Nuclear Consultative Group\" plotting to use nuclear weapons against the DPRK and is planning to stage actual nuclear operation exercises with the ROK in August.\nWhat should never be overlooked is the U.S. recent sub-critical nuclear test's impact on the military security situation of the Korean peninsula as it has added new tension to the military showdown among nuclear weapons states, fomenting the international nuclear arms race.\nTo cope with the strategic instability in the region and the rest of the world caused by the U.S. unilateral action, the DPRK cannot but reconsider the measures necessary for the improvement of the overall nuclear deterrence posture within the range of its vested sovereign right and possible options.\nThe DPRK will not tolerate the creation of strategic imbalance and security vacuum in the Korean peninsula, but firmly defend its security, rights and interests through powerful deterrent action against the evolving nuclear threat from the U.S. -0-",

Furthermore, regional peace and stability are exposed to serious threats due to the U.S. and its vassal countries' ceaseless war drills for aggression.

Therefore, it has neither justification nor authority to say this or that on the issue of the exercise of the legitimate right of a sovereign state.\nFor the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the launch of a military reconnaissance satellite is an inevitable undertaking for bolstering up the might of self-defence, and what is more, it is a matter directly related with its destiny whether to defend its independent right or not. And for the international community, it is a fundamental issue whether the spirit of sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs stipulated in the UN Charter is preserved or not.\nThe unfair behavior of the UNSC which left indelible stain on the trust and reputation of the UN organization will inevitably invite a tragic result of its own collapse.\nWe will never tolerate any moves of the hostile forces to violate the inviolable sphere under the exercise of sovereignty nor step back from having access to the space reconnaissance capability which should be done surely no matter what others may say. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- Kim Yo Jong, vice department director of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, issued the following press statement on Sunday.\nThe ROK connived at the provocative act of scattering the political agitation rubbish across the border of the DPRK again on June 6 and 7 despite our repeated warning against the intemperate psychological warfare of the scum who defected from the DPRK, thus aggravating the situation.\nIn the period between June 6 and 8, the despicable political agitation rubbish was discovered in Singye and Thosan counties of North Hwanghae Province, Jangphung County and Phanmun District of Kaesong Municipality, Kosan, Phyonggang and Cholwon counties of Kangwon Province and other areas of the DPRK near the border.\nAs already warned, the DPRK scattered 7.5 tons of waste paper with more than 1 400 balloons over the border of the ROK from the night of June 8 to the dawn of June 9.\nAs you will see, we have only scattered empty waste paper without any political agitation.\nIt is quite different from the provocative political agitation rubbish scattered by the scum of the ROK against the DPRK.\nOur minimum reaction is only the just and reflective reaction at the very low level.\nOur reaction was scheduled to end on June 9, but the situation has changed.\nThe reason was explained by the act of the ROK.\nThe loudspeaker broadcasting provocation started in the border area at last.\nThis is a prelude to a very dangerous situation.\nPoliticians of Seoul are trying hard to justify their stand with the only and strange deformed logic in the world that regulates and judges the \"freedom of expression\" and \"provocation\" in the windward direction. And they formalized their behavior just like a guilty filing the suit first that they have resumed the loudspeaker broadcasting smear campaign again against the DPRK's counteraction against their challengeable act, thus creating a new crisis.\nWe strongly denounce the despicable and childish behavior of the ROK and clarify our stand responding to it.\nIf the ROK simultaneously carries out the leaflet scattering and loudspeaker broadcasting provocation over the border, it will undoubtedly witness the new counteraction of the DPRK.\nThe ROK will suffer a bitter embarrassment of picking up waste paper without rest and it will be its daily work.\nI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once the dangerous act of bringing the further confrontation crisis and discipline itself. -0-",

The army dropped GBU-39, a GPS guided bomb, offered by the U.S.\nOn May 26, Israel dropped the same bomb on a refugee camp in Rafah, killing more than 40 civilians.\nThe whole world is vehemently censuring Israel for its massacre in disregard of international law and humanitarian principle.\nBut this time, too, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State patronized the horrible massacre, claiming that Israel did not cross the \"red line\" set by the U.S.\nAccording to his words, the \"red line\" set by Washington in connection with Israel's military operations means a \"large-scale operation in Rafah\" and it is the U.S. stand that it has not yet seen such large-scale operation.\nHis words mean that the death toll of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip that has reached nearly 40 000 is not enough for the U.S. and Israel but scarce.\nThey are the reckless remarks that can be made by only rare murderers who regard massacre as a common practice and pleasure. They revealed who is a backer for Israel running amuck in disregard of the strong denunciation by the international society and that the \"threat\" and \"warning\" against Israel touted by the U.S. before the world are no more than hypocritical sophism.\nWorld media say that the U.S. seems to make \"diplomatic efforts\" but is positively patronizing Israel's actions and driving the situation into a more dangerous phase by switching the \"blue light\" for the tragedy lasting in the Gaza Strip.\nEven at this moment, Israel's massacre is growing in the Gaza Strip under the patronage of the U.S.\nOn June 8, 274 Palestinians were mercilessly killed and nearly 700 wounded by the Israel's military attack on the mid Gaza Strip, but the U.S. \"red line\" and its rulers remain unchanged.\nThe reality goes to clearly prove that the \"red line\" set by the U.S. is not a \"check line\" for defending the international justice and humanitarianism but a \"banister\" for its stooges and murderers.\nThe world is spitting at the disgusting entity called the U.S., the chieftain of aggression and massacre which is only committing all sorts of vicious acts while styling itself the \"guardian of international order\" and \"apostle of justice and peace\". -0-",

This is a revelation of their extreme hostility towards the other party and an expression of their sinister intention to maintain the anti-Russia alliance on the basis of it.\nSuch gathering can never be a meeting for dialogue and peace and, evidently, it will be no more than a farce for confrontation and war expansion deceiving the world.\nRussia has already disclosed that the purpose of the Swiss conference is not to discuss the ways for settling the Ukrainian situation but to work out and present an unpardonable ultimatum to it. And it declared that it has no intention to take part in any event aimed at isolating and stifling itself rather than peace, strongly demanding that the agenda item be set right.\nMany countries have refused to attend this conference, claiming that all peace proposals should be discussed on a fair basis, under the condition that Russia and Ukraine recognize and each side takes part on an equal footing.\nEven media of the host country described the \"peace summit\" as a \"merrymaking of Western partners\", commenting that the conference would meet a miserable end as it does not take account of the position of the BRICS and other countries.\nIn the final analysis, the confab, prepared by the Zelenskiy puppet clique under the manipulation of the master with much effort, will bring together only groomsmen with \"bigoted fixed assets\" of NATO in the main that have not yet got rid of the yoke of \"military assistance for Ukraine\" at the U.S. beck and call. And it will show up the disgraceful looks of admitting their diplomatic failure and \"consoling\" themselves.\nIt is quite natural that the conspiratorial conference of those keen on inciting confrontation and war under the pretext of \"peace\" has come under criticism by the international community.\nThe U.S. and the West are now resorting to the formation of an international anti-Russia confrontation front together with military support to the Zelenskiy puppet clique in a bid to turn the Ukrainian war situation at any cost. But this is a self-destruction act of pricking their own eyes with their own hands and, moreover, it will only be a way far from \"peace\".\nIf the U.S. and the West continue such farce, the world will only watch the ruined shaman's rites.\nIf they truly want the solution of the Ukrainian crisis and global peace, it would be a beneficial and right behavior for them to make both sides sit at the negotiating table fairly with sincerity, not deception and hypocrisy. -0-",

This year, it is staging frantic drills for preemptive strike at the DPRK's nuclear facilities and major military bases, under the new \"operational plan 2022\", revealing its scheme for a nuclear war against the DPRK under the eyes of the world.\nNothing can compensate the mental damage suffered by the Korean people due to the U.S. ever-escalating nuclear threat.\nThe Korean people are strictly keeping tabs on all the criminal acts made by the U.S. against the DPRK that have lasted for decades, and looking forward to the moment when the U.S. will be made to pay dearly for all its crimes, the white paper says, stating:\n\"Blood for blood!\" -- this is the DPRK's norm related to irreconcilable compensation for the losses and its unshakable will to make a retaliatory punishment. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- The Ukrainian military gangsters committed an inhuman crime of killing civilians by attacking Sevastopol City of Russia with U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles tipped with cluster bombs on June 23.\nIt is not the first time for the puppet Zelenskiy clique to perpetrate such a terrorist attack against civilians.\nSince the outbreak of the Ukrainian crisis, the Kiev puppet regime has committed such crimes against innocent civilians hundreds of times by striking civilian facilities in Belgorod Region, Kursk Region and other parts of the Russian territory with lethal weapons supplied by the U.S. and other Western countries.\nWhat cannot be overlooked is the fact that the Zelenskiy puppet clique carried out the above-said bloody attack right after its American master lifted the restrictions on its use of U.S.-supplied weapons for the attack on the Russian territory.\nSome days ago, the national security adviser of the White House openly said that Kiev can use U.S.-supplied weapons to hit any Russian forces attacking from across the border, adding \"it is not about geography but about common sense.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Defense betrayed its true colors as an instigator of murder by asserting that Ukrainian forces can use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike any Russian forces not only in Kharkov Region near border but also in other parts of the Russian territory for their legitimate self-defense.\nThe U.S., which had come up with such hoodwinking restrictive conditions as \"for enabling Ukraine to defend itself\" and \"with a guarantee of not attacking the targets in the Russian territory\" when supplying weapons to the Zelenskiy puppet regime, \"allowed\" Ukraine to strike some parts of the Russian Territory earlier. This time the allowed scope of strike has been expanded to cover \"any target\" and the \"whole territory\" of Russia.\nThe U.S. has finally granted the Ukrainian puppets the right to unlimited use of U.S.-supplied weapons. This is little short of its official \"order of massacre\" to the puppets faithful to its strategy for hegemony and declaration of outright confrontation with Russia.\nThe recent atrocity, perpetrated with the bombs banned by international law and long-range weapons offered by the U.S., was an intentional \"murder by contract\" premeditated by the U.S. And this clearly proves that they have gone to extremes in their anti-Russia hysteria.\nRussia's stronger response for safeguarding the national interests and lives and security of its citizens is a just right to legitimate self-defence never to be refuted by anyone.\nThose who unhesitatingly issued an \"order to kill\" innocent civilians and the mad terrorists will be surely forced to pay dearly for the hideous crime.\nThe inhuman murderers and destroyers of peace can never escape stern punishment by history. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, June 30 (KCNA) -- The external policy office of the DPRK Foreign Ministry released the following press statement under the title \"We will continue to make important efforts to deter the acts of disturbing peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world\" on Sunday:\nThe U.S., Japan and ROK staged Freedom Edge, the first tripartite multi-domain joint military exercises in the waters near the DPRK from June 27 to 29.\nIn the past they staged many large and small joint military drills under various pretexts, but there had been no such a large-scale joint military drill dubbed with a special name.\nWe strongly denounce the U.S., Japan and ROK for their repeated reckless and provocative military muscle-flexing against the DPRK and other independent states in the region and once again seriously warn of the fatal consequences to be entailed by them.\nNow the international community unanimously comments that lurking behind the recent drill is the strategic design of the U.S. to escalate regional military tensions, exert pressure upon the Far East of Russia and lay siege to China.\nThe regular U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite joint military exercises clearly show that the U.S. strategy for world domination to encircle and contain independent and sovereign states and secure its military hegemony has already crossed the red-line and is bringing about a very negative change in the world security environment and geopolitical mechanical structure.\n\nFreedom Edge, typical expression of the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc\n\nThe danger of the first tripartite multi-domain joint military exercises between the U.S., Japan and the ROK lies not only in the fact that the armed forces of the three countries conducted drills in various operational spheres including the sea and air.\nThe gravity and danger of the situation lie in the fact that Freedom Edge is a product of the organization, systematization and actualization of the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc.\nThe U.S. is now claiming that the U.S.-Japan-ROK relations are just cooperative ones for strengthening regional stability and security and do not mean NATO of Asian version, but it is nothing but rhetoric to evade international criticism of the formation of an aggressive bloc.\nThe document, cooked up at the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite summit in August last year, specifies the immediate tripartite cooperation to cope with any threat faced by one of the three countries.\nThis is, in essence, reminiscent of NATO's principle of collective defense that it mobilizes its defense capabilities if a member country is attacked, regarding it as an attack on all.\nSince the Camp David confab, the U.S., Japan and the ROK have operated a real-time missile warning data sharing system under the pretext of coping with \"missile threat\" from someone to realize the integration in the field of military intelligence. They are also stepping up the integration of the military forces of the three countries by frequently staging joint military drills involving U.S. strategic assets.\nAs NATO stages annual joint military drills in all spheres including land, sea, air and cyberspace, the U.S., Japan and the ROK decided to regularly stage tripartite multi-domain joint military drills. This means that the U.S.-Japan-ROK relations have taken on the full-fledged appearance of Asian-version NATO.\nIn the final analysis, Freedom Edge served as an occasion for proving that the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc, the U.S. had been seeking to establish for decades, has become a present perfect form, not a continuous or future one.\n\nTrue intention in revitalization of exclusive military bloc\n\nAn official concerned of the U.S. Department of State recently asserted that Japan and the ROK are very good partners in coping with the threat from Russia.\nLurking behind this is the U.S. strategic scenario to use the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc as a three-horse carriage for carrying out its strategy for hegemony in not only Northeast Asia but also the rest of the world.\nAs already known, the ROK is a \"military colony\" which left OPECON (wartime operation control) in the hands of the U.S. and Japan is the largest overseas military base of the U.S, where more than 54 000 U.S. troops are deployed.\nThis hints that the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc is a war and aggression mechanism capable of standing in military confrontation against other countries at any time under the instruction and command of the U.S., unlike AUKUS, the security technology alliance of the U.S., Britain and Australia or the tripartite security cooperation between the U.S., Japan and the Philippines.\nIt is by no means fortuitous that the U.S. persistently tried to make the relations between NATO, the war machinery in Europe, and Japan and the ROK closely linked with each other.\nThe U.S., which had already pushed forward with the entry of Japan and the ROK into NATO 18 years ago, has got more frantic in realizing the organic bond between NATO and Japan and the ROK since it turned its strategic focus to the Asia-Pacific region.\nJapan and the ROK, which established partnerships with NATO and built channels of regular dialogue at the instigation of the U.S., are now taking part in the annual NATO summit and even in the NATO-led military exercises, further expanding their cooperation with NATO.\nAfter the outbreak of the Ukrainian crisis, Japan has been hell-bent on the moves to put pressure on Russia and the ROK has openly sought to provide the Nazi regime of Zelenskiy with lethal equipment. Such facts show that the close ties between NATO and the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc have reached a dangerous level.\nThe reality goes to prove that the \"inseparable relations\" between the security of Europe and the one of the Asia-Pacific region, touted by the U.S. and its vassal forces, are nothing but an excuse for realizing the political collusion and military integration between the NATO member states and pro-U.S. states in the Asia-Pacific region and encircling independent sovereign states.\n\nTo foil the alliance strategy of the U.S. is urgently needed to ensure international peace and stability\n\nThe Biden administration, in its \"Indo-Pacific Strategy Report\" and the \"National Security Strategy Report\", called on its allies in Asia and Europe to unite with each other to counter their strategic rivals.\nRecently, it has asserted that its alliance strategy is making the switch from a \"hub-and-spoke one\" of forming various bilateral alliances to a \"lattice-like one\" of forming several multi-lateral alliances cooperating with each other. It also claimed that the era of \"alliance protection\" is over and the era of \"alliance action\" has arrived.\nThis proves that the primary goal of the U.S. strategy for world domination is to form a global siege network to contain independent sovereign states which are opposed to its high-handed and arbitrary practices.\nSuch confrontational attempt of the U.S. is the root cause of fomenting political instability and military confrontation and triggering off bloody wars and touch-and-go security crises in different parts of the world.\nThe prevailing situation requires the independent sovereign states to steadily bolster up their self-defensive power to defend the security of the state and, at the same time, further strengthen mutual cooperation and concerted action so as to establish a structure of forces capable of effectively deterring the hostile forces' collective military intervention.\nThe U.S. and its vassal forces' expansion of the aggressive bloc and escalating military confrontation that wreck peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the region will be surely deterred by the powerful and coordinated counteraction of independent sovereign states.\nThe DPRK will never overlook the moves of the U.S. and its followers to strengthen the military bloc, which openly destroys the security environment on the Korean peninsula and gravely threatens global peace and stability, but firmly defend the sovereignty, security and interests of the state and peace in the region through offensive and overwhelming countermeasures. -0-",

And it will reportedly take about 30 years to discharge all nuclear-polluted water into the sea in this way.\nMankind is bound to face a horrible nuclear disaster due to Japan's shameless and irresponsible discharge of nuclear-polluted water.\nThis is not an empty talk but a reality that is approaching.\nThis is well evidenced by such facts giving rise to serious concern that the concentration of tritium (radioactive substance) in seawater near the Fukushima Atomic Power Plant has risen considerably and fishes have been killed in shoals since Japan started the discharge of nuclear-polluted water into the sea.\nNevertheless, Japan is insisting on the \"safe management\" and \"clearly treated water\". It is no more than an intolerable far-fetched sophism.\nFinally, all the countries and the whole regions in the world are completely exposed to the danger of global nuclear disaster unprecedented in history by the one state Japan nowadays.\nEven in the stark reality, Japan has persistently discharged the nuclear-polluted water into the sea for a long time in a bid to make its criminal moves \"normal activities\" by \"immunizing\" the international community and evade protest and denunciation focused on Japan.\nJapan, which invaded and occupied other countries and nations in the past and inflicted untold misfortune on them, is now bringing another grave disaster to mankind by unhesitatingly discharging a huge amount of dangerous nuclear-polluted water into the sea.\nIn fact, it is the stereotyped method of the cunning Japanese reactionaries to gradually pull down the \"wall\" of the international community just like a mouse gnawing a hole, blur the attention of the world people and then switch to a new phase of crimes when it is committing all sorts of crimes such as denying the past history and reviving militarism.\nThe international community should not tolerate criminal moves seriously threatening the human existence, sharply seeing through the crafty intention of Japan to \"dilute\" its crimes with its shameless sophism, the \"normal discharge of treated water\". -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, a delegation of the U.S. House of Representatives toured the Middle East.\nWe do not feel the need to comment on such despicable junket by politicians of the U.S., rejected by its population for having squandered tax only while failing to deal with home affairs. However, we cannot but refer to the fact that they fabricated and spread groundless rumors about the DPRK.\nUnexpectedly talking about the DPRK's \"threat\" over the Middle East situation fraught with a new danger, they asserted that tragedy of bloodshed in the region is being caused by someone's \"intervention\" or \"support\".\nThis clearly proves how desperately the U.S. has stuck to the smear campaign for tarnishing the image of the dignified DPRK and \"demonizing\" it.\nEveryone understands that the Middle East crisis was arisen and Israel has steadily committed massacre despite the denunciation by the world community as the U.S. has patronized and backed the Zionists and inspired their war hysteria.\nEven major Western media recently cited the figures and data to prove that Israel's large-scale indiscriminate military attacks on Gaza Strip are ascribable to the support of the U.S., which has unsparingly offered a large amount of munitions including high-explosive bombs and various kinds of missiles in every way.\nThis being a hard fact, American politicians have persistently intrigued against the DPRK, which is far from the Middle East. What is their purpose?\nIt is well-known to everyone that the U.S. has frequently raised such sophism as someone's \"threat\" and \"provocation\" in the international arena in a bid to slander the DPRK and justify its hegemonic moves.\nHowever, the power and position of the DPRK have not been weakened but remarkably increased, further making the U.S. feel uneasy. The world people unanimously recognize this development as a \"great failure of the U.S. anti-DPRK policy\".\nSo, the way out the U.S. finally found is to mislead the public opinion as if the daily-growing global danger is attributable to the DPRK by unreasonably linking the proxy wars, staged by itself in different parts of the world, with \"the DPRK's intervention and support\" and thus divert the focus of intensive international criticism and pressure to the latter.\nGiven the U.S. politicians deliberately link the cause of the escalating tension in the Middle East with the DPRK in a bid to tide over the worst crisis which makes the U.S. driven into a predicament, their nervous prostration is seemly developing into psychosis.\nBut the truth never changes.\nNo matter what silly jargons may be let out by any riff-raffs, the heinous crimes of the U.S., the axis of evil wrecking global peace and stability, and its crime-woven history can never be covered and it is more impossible to shift the blame onto others.\nThe DPRK's responsible mission to defend peace and stability in the region and the rest of the world can never be denied by anyone's effort to infamize the DPRK, and the cheap rumors fabricated by the U.S. to justify the \"bloody dinner\" only show the poor nature of the \"only superpower\" breathing its last. -0-",

True to his special instruction, Sinpho in South Hamgyong Province, a typical coastal city with a small area under cultivation compared to its population, was set as a model for this year and preparations have been made to this end.\nOn July 15,Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, together with senior officials of the Party and the government, visited the Phungo-dong area in Sinpho, South Hamgyong Province, and looked round the site of an offshore farm to be built, acquainting himself with the project plan. He then convened a consultative meeting of officials concerned on the spot.\nPresent there were Kim Tok Hun, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and premier of the Cabinet, Jo Yong Won, Ri Il Hwan, Kim Jae Ryong, Pak Thae Song and other secretaries of the WPK Central Committee, Pak Jong Gun, vice-premier of the Cabinet and chairman of the State Planning Commission, major commanding officers of the armed forces organs and relevant officials in the province and in the design sector.\nKim Jong Unpresided over the meeting.\nThe meeting discussed the issues arising in building the Sinpho City Offshore Farm into a new fine model for shallow-sea culture, generalizing it to bring about a substantial improvement in the economic development and the people\u2019s living standards in coastal cities and counties, and more dynamically pushing forward with the Party\u2019s regional development policy.\nReferring to the purpose of the convening of the meeting,Kim Jong Unanalyzed the economic potential of the seas and the importance and significance of their effective exploitation and use of their resources by the coastal cities and counties in successfully bringing about the epochal change in the 10-year revolution for the regional development which has entered the full-scale phase of its implementation, and set forth practical tasks and ways to this end.\nHe stressed that developing and making good use of their natural and economic resources in regions is very important to secure the independence and driving force of the regional economic development and, furthermore, to develop the country\u2019s economic potentials in a unified and development-oriented way.\nHe said that only when the regions create an atmosphere for balanced and competitive growth by building up the foundations for their independent and sustainable development in all the local areas, can the regional economy develop, and the more the regional economy develops, the greater the motive power of the overall economy will become, contributing to the strategic economic potential growth.\nThe consultative meeting heard the data on the economic profits and effectiveness of the Sinpho City Offshore Farm.\nKim Jong Unseriously analyzed the reasons why the Party\u2019s policy on developing the regional economy by making good use of the mountains in mountainous areas and the sea in the coastal regions has not been implemented so far. He stressed that the policies consistently maintained by the Party on narrowing the gaps between urban and rural areas in economic life can be implemented only when the state provides all the conditions and possibilities for the economic growth in regions in a responsible manner.\nSaying that if the scallop and kelp farming is conducted well in the waters off the Phungo-dong area the city of Sinpho, which is poor in economic potentials, can become the richest among the cities and counties in the country in three to four years, he expressed his determination to successfully build up the Sinpho City Offshore Farm into a model of aquaculture in the new century and present it to the people in the city as a gift.\nHe continued that it is the unique ties between the WPK and the army, their most sacred tradition and the decisive guarantee for victory in the revolution that when the Party leading the revolution plans any project, the army unconditionally carries it out, always holding it as an honourable historic mission. He entrusted the construction of the Sinpho City Offshore Farm to the Korean People\u2019s Army units.\nHe expressed expectation that the KPA, absolutely loyal to the Party\u2019s ideas, leadership and orders, would successfully build the model of offshore farming, to which the state attaches importance, and present it to the Party and the people as an outcome of its steadfast revolutionary stand and patriotic spirit.\nHe stressed the need for relevant units to responsibly carry out the tasks assigned to them as regards the construction of the Sinpho City Offshore Farm.\nHe instructed the Party Central Committee to set a creative example to be generalized and applied to other parts of the country by taking direct charge of the construction of the farm and powerfully and substantially pushing ahead with it. He also made sure that a division in charge of offshore farm construction was set up in the non-permanent committee for promoting the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy to exclusively supervise and guide the construction of aquaculture bases in other coastal cities and counties.\nPointing out that the layout of the farm, submitted by the design sector, was not worked out at the level appropriate to a model creation of the aquacultural industry in the new century, he stressed the need to conduct a sincere study in a more innovative manner and create a new one so as to make the construction of the farm another revolutionary stage of development in designing industrial facilities, and indicated the orientation of designing.\nLike all other undertakings, the development of aquaculture should be based on scientific guarantee and calculation along with proactive introduction of advanced technologies, he said, calling for giving priority to the selection of superior strains and paying primary attention to raising the scientific level to the maximum in the whole process, ranging from the management of the sea-farming ground to the preservation of ecological environment.\nThe consultative meeting took relevant measures after specifying practical tasks, including those for the senior city and county officials to comprehensively investigate the natural and geographical features and economic potentials of the regions under their charge and conduct a scrupulous study and organizational work to fully exploit them, to perfect the legal and institutional mechanisms to make the preferential measures for regional economic development prove effective, and to direct efforts to training core technicians and skilled workers in all cities and counties.\nAfter the meeting,Kim Jong Unwent round the waters for aquaculture by the farm.\nLearning about the shellfish farming under way on a trial basis, he said that the waters off the Phungo-dong area are favourable for aquaculture in various aspects, including water quality, depth and temperature. With his heart filled with deep emotion, he pictured in his mind the morrow of the Sinpho citizens who will enjoy happiness along with the wonderful change in their region.\nConvinced of the sure prospects of aquaculture and the possibility of its development, all the officials, who took part in the consultative meeting in the presence ofKim Jong Un, made a firm pledge to perform remarkable feats in the proudest and most worthwhile struggle by remaining true to their mission and duty in the struggle for placing the current new phase of regional development on a track of rapid promotion.\nThe consultative meeting will be recorded in history as a crucial watershed that set up an epochal milestone for the regional economic development of our own style and as today\u2019s \u201cChangsong Joint Conference\u201d that instilled into all the Party members and other people stronger confidence in the creation of a new life and happiness. -0-",

Thanks to his ceaseless devotion and wise leadership, magnificent and grand scenery is unfolding as a paradise of people in Myongsasimni, a scenic spot along the East Sea of Korea.\nAll the builders have turned out in high spirits with a firm determination to successfully complete the construction of the Wonsan Kalma coastal tourist area and fully demonstrate the validity of the people-first politics of the WPK. They are performing fresh miraculous feats day after day, true toKim Jong Un\u2019s noble intention to make devoted service for the well-being of the people, so as to attain without fail the construction goal set forth by the Party Central Committee.\nFeasting his eyes on the panoramic view of the vast tourist area stretching along a 4km coastline,Kim Jong Un, with a broad smile on his face, said that it was really beautiful and spectacular and he felt refreshed both in mind and body as he saw the scenery peculiar to the picturesque coastal area, and repeatedly expressed great satisfaction at the fact that it had taken on an impeccable appearance as a world-level coastal tourist city as planned.\nHe highly praised the builders for bringing about collective innovations in ensuring both the speed and quality of construction with a death-defying spirit, true to the Party Central Committee\u2019s plan to build the tourist resort as a monumental edifice of eternal value for the people.\nHe stressed the need to further expand the successes, not slackening the high spirit, as the project had entered its final stage, calling on the commanding officials to make a more exacting demand, the builders to display redoubled efforts and the construction inspection organs to enhance their sense of responsibility and role to the maximum.\nHe held a consultative meeting with officials accompanying him on the spot to discuss the practical matters for making full preparations for the operation of the tourist area according to a well-thought-out plan as the 19th Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party had decided to open the coastal tourist area by next May.\nStressing the importance of making good preparations for the operation of the tourist area, he said it is important to build a wonderful resort but the key issue is to ensure perfect services appropriate to its class. However fashionable its facilities are, it will lower its value as a tourist resort if the level of their services is low, he added.\nNoting that the capacity of the services and its feasibility should be scientifically examined to properly select service units, he called for making preparations for operation on a full scale from now on. And he specified the orientation for doing so and took a series of important measures.\nThe meeting discussed all the issues arising in the preparations for ensuring smooth operation of the tourist area, including those of ensuring the parking space as suited to the capacity of the tourist area, building an amusement park and a leisure activity area, building up the capacity for garbage and sewage treatment and training experts for all the categories of services.\nWonsan is a coastal city of natural and geographical beauty, and, in particular, Myongsasimni at the Kalma peninsula has long been known as a famous scenic spot, he said, adding that a marine park of national value to be known to the world as the best tourist resort of the country would be successfully built and Myongsasimni will win the fame as a pride of Wonsan and a 4km-long stretch of beach crowded with the people in the near future.\nStressing that tourism should be developed in a long-term manner on the basis of the experience gained in the construction of the coastal tourist area, he said that as our country is surrounded by sea on its eastern and western sides and has many scenic spots on its eastern coast, including Mt Kumgang, Mt Chilbo, Majon, Kumya, Riwon and Yombunjin, it is needed to steadily implement the policy of concentrating on making rational use of the abundant coastal resources of tourism. And he called for taking long-term steps to exploit in a unique manner the resources of coastal tourism for sports, leisure activities and marine sightseeing.\nAfter receiving the important instructions ofKim Jong Unthat clearly indicated the path for a new development in the country\u2019s tourism and advanced guidelines and ways for achieving comprehensive rejuvenation of Korean-style socialism and providing the people with a happier life, all the officials renewed their faith that the plans and determinations of the Party Central Committee are an immutable science and truth, and made a firm pledge to fulfil their responsibility and duty in the important and worthwhile struggle for creating improved civilization for the people, remaining faithful to his leadership. -0-",

Such situation indicates that the \"right to self-defense\" advocated by Israel is nothing but a \"right\" to massacre and plunder.\nThe seizure of land committed again in the hotbed of massacre goes to fully prove that the onslaught and vandalism, being perpetrated by Israel with the backing of the U.S. on pleas of an exercise of the \"right to self-defense\" and \"defensive action,\" constitute genocide to drive the Palestinians out of their home and eternally occupy their territory.\nThe \"right to self-defense\" is inappropriate to Israel as it is a hideous occupier and destroyer of regional stability that has expanded its territory through bloody aggression and massacre against Palestinians and other Arab peoples, while persistently hindering the legitimate foundation of the State of Palestine.\nIt is the height of double-standards and a tragedy of this world that the U.S. and the West, which often call for respecting nations' self-determination specified in the UN Charter and international law, have connived at the most outrageous territorial expansion being pursued by the Zionists.\nThis jungle-law-prevailing reality, in which one cannot but shed tears if his fist is not strong, requires us to fully cement our strength for self-defense, the foundation of our nation's existence and guarantee for its eternal development, to be invincible. -0-",

Yon Hyong Muk, Pak Song Bong and Sim Chang Wan, who were bullet-proof walls in defending the Supreme Headquarters during the hard-fought war, bearing the firm faith that all victories and glory lie in

commander, who has put the dignity and mightiness of socialist Korea on the highest level in history, handing over the tradition of great July 27 victory and the heroic spirit to posterity.\nAt the end of the march, an air squadron of the KPA Air Force flew in the sky above the square in a fan-shaped formation, adding to the joy of the war victory day.\nThe cheers of excitement reverberated far and wide, and fireworks were set off in the nocturnal sky of July.\nKim Jong Unwarmly waved back to the enthusiastically cheering masses, holding his hands high.\nThe ceremony of the commemorative

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 28 (KCNA) -- All the people and service personnel of the DPRK are grandly celebrating July 27, the day of great war victory recorded in the history of the country with immortal gold letters. They are extending sincere respect and warm congratulations to the defenders of the country in the 1950s, the most heroic generation and indomitable models that brought about the eternal glory of a powerful Korea.\nThe legendary feats the victorious wartime generation performed in saving the state and nation and their future, honourably defending peace and security of mankind and laying a solid foundation for building a rich country with a strong army, true to the ideology and guidance of the leader, are shining forever along with their noble name, and the matchless ideological and spiritual strength the brave warriors displayed in the war serves as an invincible might guaranteeing the steady and victorious advance of the cause of Juche.\nA meeting with the victorious wartime generation took place in Pyongyang, the capital city of the DPRK, on July 27, the 71st anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War with the sense of mission of the successors developing to firmly carry forward the great spirit of defending the country and the tradition of victory.\nThe Pyongyang Indoor Stadium, venue of the meeting, was filled with the pride of the victorious wartime generation that provided a precious asset to be handed down to posterity with ardent patriotism, loyalty and devotion and the ideological and spiritual heritage of the country and its people, and the warm respect of the younger generation for the revolutionary elders and the great pride of all the participants in being citizens of the victor nation.\nThe participants greeted with enthusiastic applause the war veterans and persons of wartime merits who were entering the venue of the meeting, wearing orders and medals shining with the proud feats of defeating the U.S. imperialists amid the playing of the light melody of the song \"July 27, Our Victory Day.\"\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was present at the meeting.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Unarrived at the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium and met war veterans who had worked for a long time at important posts of the Party, government and military, and exchanged warm greetings with them.\nWhenKim Jong Unappeared on the platform together with war veterans amid the playing of welcome music, all the participants broke into enthusiastic cheers of \"Hurrah!\" looking up toKim Jong Un, incarnation of the great dignity and strength of our invincible Party and powerful state and the banner of all victories and glory.\nChildren presented bouquets toKim Jong Unand war veterans.\nWaving back to the enthusiastic cheering crowds,Kim Jong Unextended warm congratulations to war veterans and all the civilians and service personnel across the country on the anniversary of victory.\nMembers of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and other senior officials of the Party, government and military were present there together with the participants in the celebrations of the 71st anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War, officials of the Party Central Committee, service personnel, officials and persons of merits of ministries, national agencies and Pyongyang Municipality, students of revolutionary schools, university students and schoolchildren.\nPresent there at invitation were diplomatic envoys and members of missions of foreign countries in Pyongyang.\nThe national anthem of the DPRK was played.\nRi Il Hwan, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, made a speech.\nOn the authorization ofKim Jong Unand the Party and the government, he warmly congratulated the war veterans, all the civilians and service personnel who greeted the V-Day with precious memories and great pride, and paid high tribute to the heroic soldiers and patriots who fell in the sacred war for defending the country.\nIt is the pride of our state and people and fortune of the younger generation that we have a significant meeting with creators and personifiers of the great history on the most precious holiday of the country, he said, adding that it is the honour of our generation to remember not only with pain but also with honour the dramatic era that turned the years of the most disastrous war into those of greatest victory.\nThanks to the honour of war victory, our state could have a remarkable strength that can be gained only by a victor nation and the Korean people could have acquired a valuable spiritual wealth which could not be obtained in ordinary days and which could not be learned by reading thousands of books, he said.\nIt is the proud tradition and characteristics of the Korean revolution to have created and defended the more than 70 years with the wartime spirit, he said, stressing that the defenders of the country in the 1950s who honourably safeguarded the glorious DPRK and provided the immortal heroic spirit are genuine patriots and models of ardent revolutionaries who would be praised and learned from for ever.\nHe said that today's grand festival is the peak of honour provided together by the generation who won victory in the war and the successors' generations who have bravely carried out the mission of defenders while turning the decades, which were no less arduous than the war, into the ones of legendary miracles and leaps forward in defence of the victory.\nThe spirit of the victorious wartime generation is the immortal soul that makes us demonstrate our dignity as an eternally powerful and great people, and we will win greater and more valuable victories by dynamically carrying it forward, he said, extending once again heartfelt thanks and best wishes to the war veterans who devoted their great soul to the ever-lasting history of victory and to the ever-victorious country.\nThe participants watched a video showing the feats and fighting spirit of the victorious wartime generation.\nThe war on the newly-built DPRK, a genuine people's country in the eastern part of the earth, was the enforcement of the U.S. imperialists' strategy for world domination aimed at enslaving our country, Asia and, furthermore, the whole of mankind. The confrontation with the arrogant imperialist ringleader with more than 100 years of history of aggressive war was an enormous challenge to our country with a history of less than two years after its founding.\nThe scenes showed that the Korean war forced by the U.S. imperialists was a war of unprecedented massacre, during which innocent people, nearly one-sixth of the total population of the DPRK at the time, were killed, outnumbering the fallen soldiers, and a great turmoil beyond human imagination in its brutality, atrocity and cruelty.\nThe war veterans and persons of wartime merits recalled the shock of 70-odd years ago, when all the people turned out in the do-or-die resistance for the future of a powerful country to change the course of history and define the direction of the course only with victories cherishing the solemn mission to prove that the DPRK was no longer a weak country and its people were never a weak people and the unbreakable self-respect.\nOther scenes showed that the rifles, which were used to kill more enemies with bayonets than bullets in battles where the difference in forces between the enemy and the DPRK could not be compared, were loaded with all the strength of miracles and indomitable spirit that brought about the great war victory.\nThe participants keenly realized the soul and spirit the victorious wartime generation had cherished, seeing the soldiers who carved on the rock a pledge of loyalty to the leader before death-defying, hand-to-hand fight, the soldiers who pressed the trigger of heavy machine-gun with the jaw after being wounded in the arms and legs and who blocked the enemy\u2019s pillboxes with their chests when hand grenades ran out, and the flags of the DPRK that were hoisted on the hills at the cost of blood and lives of the soldiers.\nThe historic scenes proved that the rear was also the front for the people who fought for victory in the war, with ardent love and bitter hatred, the day of victory was brought earlier and the precious tradition to be preserved and glorified forever was prepared thanks to the all-people movements including the movement of volunteering for military service on the front, emulation drive for increased production, drive for extra-haulage, women\u2019s movement to plough the fields, high-yield movement and the campaign for donating grains for the front.\nAll the participants realized once again that the wise leadership of PresidentKim Il Sung, who led the war with his outstanding military strategic ideas and tactics and brought up ordinary people into the masters of the heroic era with his warm love and trust unprecedented in history, and the unshakable faith of all the people and service personnel that they were sure to win as they were led by him were the key to winning victory in the war.\nThe scenes showing the might of the DPRK which defends its sovereignty, national interests and genuine peace with matchless self-defensive capability that can defeat any formidable enemy impressively taught all those who grew up in this powerful country free from the worries of the outbreak of war the truth that the history of winning the victory is great, but the history of succession which has defended and steadily carried it forward is still more ennobling.\nThe bouquets presented by the younger generation to the war veterans, who devoted themselves to the victory only and to the great power associated with the desire of their comrades-in-arms, were an expression of boundless reverence and ardent respect for them.\nAll the participants renewed their firm will to carry forward the glorious tradition of victory for ever by remaining loyal to the ideas and leadership of the great Party Central Committee which is cementing the military powerful strength for the future of the revolution and the nation.\nArmy Colonel Ri Un Ryong and Navy Lieutenant Commander Yu Kyong Song, officers of the Korean People's Army, made oath-taking speeches.\nExpressing their impression of seeing the fateful moments on the screen that the victorious wartime generation faced and the days of the fierce war, the speakers said that the matchless bravery and feats of many heroic soldiers who won the great victory, made them more keenly aware of the important mission of the defenders standing on the defence line of the country.\nThey said that our revolutionary armed forces have grown to be a personifier of extraordinary courage, strength and dignity, confident of victory, looking down at any formidable enemy, thanks to the revolutionary spirit and immortal feats of the victorious wartime generation, who turned the fateful years which could have ended in tragedy into the most proud ones.\nOut of surging hatred against the U.S. imperialists and the puppet ROK military gangsters hell-bent on provoking a nuclear war beyond the southern border of the DPRK even at this moment, they expressed their will to glorify with greater miracles and victories the feats of the guards units which struck the enemy with fear of ruin and brought about brilliant results in the battles and the legendary tale in the world history of naval battle, in which four torpedo boats sank a heavy cruiser of the U.S. Navy.\nThe speakers solemnly pledged beforeKim Jong Unand the Party and the state to become brave fighters in defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity and the territorial waters of the country, bearing in mind the lifetime intentions and requests of the war veterans, and to bolster up the thoroughgoing capability to cope with war and fighting efficiency in every way so as to make an overwhelming attack on the enemy anytime and without delay and annihilate them once Supreme CommanderKim Jong Ungives an order.\nWhen the meeting was over, enthusiastic cheers resounded in the venue again.\nKim Jong Unwished for long life in good health of all the war veterans, who have lived with struggle and devotion for the prosperity of their beloved country and happiness of their descendants and left beautiful traces in their life, and extended warm greetings to all the participants for a long time, hoping that they will all cherish the sacred dignity and honour of being citizens of the victor nation and firmly carry forward the soul of the victorious wartime generation.\nAll the participants were deeply moved by his world of noble revolutionary obligation and comradely love for the war veterans.\nThe meeting with the victorious wartime generation held on the occasion of the 71st anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War marked a significant occasion for redoubling the unshakable faith, courage, enthusiasm and fighting will of all the people and service personnel of the country to firmly carry forward the history and tradition of the sacred victory, glorify them for all ages and achieve without fail the great cause of building a rich country with a strong army as desired by the victorious wartime generation under the leadership of the great Party Central Committee. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) --Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, visited the flood-hit areas in the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County of North Phyongan Province on July 28.\nHe was accompanied by Jo Yong Won and Pak Thae Song, secretaries of the Central Committee of the WPK.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Unwas greeted on the spot by Pak Jong Chon, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, the minister of National Defence and other commanding officers of the Korean People's Army.\nHe guided the work for the rescue and evacuation of the inhabitants from the areas hit by a downpour and disaster-predicted areas.\nOn July 27, a record downpour struck the northern border of the DPRK and the areas of the Chinese side and the water level of the Amnok River far exceeded the danger line. This created a serious crisis, in which more than 5 000 inhabitants were isolated in the zones vulnerable to flooding in several island areas of the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County of North Phyongan Province.\nImmediately after the crisis occurred, leading officials of the Party, government and military were dispatched rapidly to the spot and helicopters of the Air Force of the KPA and various kinds of lifeboats of the Navy and a maritime guard formation of the Border Guards were promptly committed to the operation for rescuing the inhabitants according to the assignment directly given byKim Jong Un.\nAfter arriving at an air base, where the rescue operation was under way, by driving along flooded rough roads,Kim Jong Unlearned from commanding officers about the inhabitants in the flood-prone zones and the situation of the rescue operation.\nHe personally guided the operation, watching the whole course of the operation by ten-odd helicopters rescuing the inhabitants in the unfavourable weather conditions and emergency while making more than 20 rounds of consecutive shuttle flights.\nThe rescued people saw him waiting for them at the airport exposed to heavy rainstorm so unexpectedly and broke into cheers, shedding tears of deep gratitude and emotion.\nKim Jong Uninstructed the regional Party organizations and power organs to offer medical assistance to the rescued people by enlisting all possibilities lest they should feel any slight inconvenience.\nAs he talked with commanding officers and pilots of the air unit, he heard the situation in the afflicted areas and repeatedly requested them to rescue everyone without fail. He also saw to it that reconnaissance flights were reorganized several times even in the areas where the rescue operation was completed.\nHe encouraged the pilots who successfully rescued more than 4 200 people and shook hands with every one of them. He said with pleasure that the helicopters' rescue of so many people from the flooded areas in a little over a quarter of a day is an incredible miracle and a living example of air rescue operation and that it is a source of pride of our Party and state to have such excellent people\u2019s Air Force and it is his honour to be the supreme commander of such an army.\nHe highly appreciated the amazing feats performed in the rescue operation, saying that the characteristics of the people's Air Force faithful to its inherent mission were clearly demonstrated once again and that all the people across the country would feel grateful to the devoted efforts made by the Air Force and its spirit of unconditionally and death-defyingly serving the people.\nIn particular, the commander of a helicopter group fulfilled a difficult task for rescue flight in the van and possesses splendid capabilities and qualifications as a commanding officer, he said, adding delightedly that he has found out in a combat environment another excellent commanding officer to be emulated by the entire army. And he warmly encouraged him, patting him on the back.\nHe set forth the tasks and ways for concentrating all efforts on the rehabilitation and relief work to minimize the losses caused by the disaster and eradicate its aftermath as soon as possible and for taking timely measures aimed at preventing recurrence in the future.\nSaying that the flood damage in the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County is very serious, he stressed that leading officials and forces at all levels in the capital city and regions should be mobilized ideologically and promptly in the rehabilitation project while giving top priority to the protection of people's lives and property.\nHe said that primary attention should be paid to the medical prevention and treatment and the provision of living conditions for the flood victims to quickly stabilize their living and, in this regard, the Party and power organs in the relevant regions should supply relief goods including foods, medicines and daily necessities fully to the victims and console them, and that state support measures should be taken simultaneously.\nHe gave an instruction on convening an emergency meeting, saying that immediate steps should be taken to prevent further disasters as downpour is still expected in this region and full preparations made in advance to start taking permanent rehabilitation measures at once immediately after the danger of flooding has disappeared.\nSome areas in the counties on the shore of the Amnok River in North Phyongan, Jagang and Ryanggang provinces, including the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County, should be declared as special-level disaster emergency areas, and the Cabinet, commissions, ministries, national agencies, public security and armed forces organs and other institutions at all levels should  turn out in the damage prevention and rehabilitation campaign with all their forces and equipment so as to quickly remove the damage and restore the order of production and life to a normal level, he said, adding that important measures will be taken to this end.\nNoting that it is the most important and responsible task to take prior measures for preventing any accident rather than making haste for taking follow-up steps after its occurrence, he stressed the need for all regions and relevant sectors to remain alert on the highest level, so as to cope with the rainy season constantly bringing danger of flood damage, and pay the most primary attention to such undertakings for preventing the recurrence of flood damage as finding out and removing risk factors in advance, evacuating the inhabitants in a predictable and timely way and establishing a scientific flooding forecast and orderly information and control system.\nIt is important to take thoroughgoing rehabilitation measures, but I cannot but mention again the serious lesson taught by the present grave situation, he said, severely criticizing officials of relevant state organs and regions for their negligence of duty that caused the inevitable disastrous situation owing to their failure to take any flood prevention measures.\nNoting that he has already stressed more than once that proper emergency response measures should be taken to prevent damage by downpour, flooding and typhoon, he said:  I've already given a repeated warning to the irresponsible attitude to such serious practices on the part of officials. And the state repeatedly gave a precaution before the rainy season and the National Emergency Response Committee met on July 22, just a few days ago. But I can\u2019t understand why officials at major posts are not yet on red alert with regard to the natural disaster prevention work. Their indolence and expediency have reached a very serious level.\nWhenever they made a mistake, officials say they have realized its seriousness and will make redoubled efforts, but natural disasters still fail to be prevented, he said, adding:   This is due to the fact that, seized with defeatism in the struggle against natural disaster, they have not turned out with confidence in the disaster prevention work, hoping for the best while making themselves reliant entirely on the weather.    Consequently, though the National Emergency Response Committee has met on a regular basis and the emergency response committees were organized and have been operated in the capital city and provinces, they remain only in form, failing to play practical functions and roles.\nSaying that as was revealed this time, disaster prevention institutions were helpless as they had secured no proper essential rescue means to be used in case of disaster and so, the army was compelled to be seconded to the rescue operation, he seriously pointed out that what could not be overlooked any longer is just the irresponsible and non-militant attitude of the public security organ responsible for thoroughly defending the life and security of the people.\nThe county emergency disaster response commanding group and the Ministry of Public Security caused a temporary confusion in the rescue operation due to their failure in properly grasping even the number of the people in the areas vulnerable to the disaster and the number of the people rescued by the KPA was much larger than the number they had reported, he noted, saying this clearly showed what a serious phase their irresponsibility reached in direct proportion to the miraculous successes made by the KPA in rescuing the lives of more than 5 000 people.\nHe said that it is a quite ignorant and dishonest attitude to leave the lives and property of the precious people and the wealth of the country to the mercy of nature, as seen through the current flood damage in some parts of the country. And he stressed that it is quite possible to prevent any accident, if the disaster prevention work is seriously accepted as a matter of attitude and viewpoint on service toward the state and people and an important political and ideological matter, not merely a campaign against natural disaster, and measures are taken with high alertness to foresee even the worst situation.\nHe stated that, through this opportunity, cautions are given to all Party and power organs across the country so as to prevent all manner of damage by the disastrous abnormal weather. -0-",

He then proposed to strictly punish those who severely neglected their responsible duties assigned by the Party and the state and thus caused even casualties, a practice that cannot be pardoned.\nSaying that the people are observing the meeting even at this moment as they trust the Party, he underscored the need to take all measures in a powerful and detailed manner to remove the aftermath as soon as possible, mindful of the expectation of the people and the important mission before them, and set forth important tasks and ways to this end.\nHe stressed that measures should be taken to urgently supply the reserve materials for emergency disaster relief to quickly stabilize the living of the people in the flood-hit areas, and that the Cabinet and relevant ministries and national agencies should be actively mobilized in this work.\nHe detailed the practical issues arising in the rehabilitation work, including those of correctly surveying the damage and losses in provinces and, on this basis, making a scientific calculation of the scale of rehabilitation projects, manpower and budget, of ensuring promptness in the projects by enlisting the design forces in the capital city and regional areas without delay and giving precedence to designing and of dispatching construction workforce as soon as possible and fully supplying and transporting materials.\nSaying that it is necessary to thoroughly prevent additional damage caused by the disastrous climate in the future, he called on the meteorological forecast sector to make weather forecast in a responsible manner and on every sector and unit to make thoroughgoing preparations for preventing damage with the highest degree of awareness and, in particular, to make sure that no casualty is caused.\nCalling for dynamically pushing ahead with the work of rapidly stockpiling essential equipment and apparatuses for rescue operation at a time when disaster occurs, he made public important measures for it.\nCalling upon the participants in the meeting including members of the Political Bureau to visit the tents where the flood victims of Uiju County are staying temporarily and thus feel the sense of their heavy responsibility while directly seeing their living conditions, console and encourage them, make a deep study of detailed measures for rehabilitation, listening to their candid opinions, and submit the measures to the Political Bureau, he concluded the first-day sitting.\nThe second-day sitting took place on July 30.\nThe meeting studied the draft decision on the immediate repair of the flood damage.\nThe decision \u201cOn rapidly repairing the flood damage in North Phyongan and Jagang provinces,\u201d which additionally reflected the results of study and opinions of the participants, was adopted with unanimous approval at the meeting.\nThe meeting appointed Ri Hi Yong, former first deputy department director of the Organizational Leadership Department of the WPK Central Committee, as chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, Pak Song Chol, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, as chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK and Pang Tu Sop, first deputy department director of the Department of Political Leadership over Military Affairs of the WPK Central Committee, as minister of Public Security.\nConcluding the meeting,Kim Jong Unsaid that we have faced a crisis several times, but each time we have been brave and offensive in the face of it and always worked only miracles and there is nothing impossible as long as there are the leadership of the Party and the army and people that are faithful to the Party. He ardently called for stoutly turning out in the face of this crisis and making miraculous achievements.\nThe 22nd emergency enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Eighth Central Committee of the WPK will shine long in the history of the WPK as an epochal occasion for putting the buildup of the disaster prevention and management capability of the country onto a new high and as an important political event that clearly demonstrated once again the sacred mission and people-oriented character of the WPK which gives top and absolute priority to the interests of the people and makes selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 3 (KCNA) -- The people\u2019s Air Force of the Korean People\u2019s Army perfectly carried out the special order of the Central Military Commission of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea by rapidly flying to the flooded areas in the northwestern part of North Phyongan Province and rescuing over 4 200 precious lives. The legendary feats of the courageous red flying corps of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea that displayed an indomitable fighting spirit are stirring the whole country.\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the WPK and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, on August 2 paid a congratulatory visit to the helicopter unit of the Air Force of the KPA that performed a miracle of air rescue operation.\nLining up at the unit\u2019s apron with national flag fluttering were the helicopters which were dispatched to the flooded areas to save the people.\nAll the officers and men, waiting for the moment of greeting the respected ComradeKim Jong Unat their unit, were filled with boundless reverence for the Supreme Commander, who, with the warmest love for the people and the will to save their lives at any cost, organized and commanded the rescue operation in a dangerous flooded area and brought about an unprecedented miracle and bestowed all laurels on them.\nWhenKim Jong Unarrived, the service personnel of the Air Force burst into cheers of \"Hurrah!\" as a token of their highest tribute and glory to the great brilliant commander.\nHe received a salute from the commander of the KPA Air Force.\nHe paid tribute to the colours of the KPA Air Force and of the unit.\nHe was greeted by leading commanding officers of the Air Force and commanding officers of the unit.\nResponding to the enthusiastic cheers, he extended warm greetings to the reliable soldiers who glorified the name of the people\u2019s Air Force with their brilliant military feats in the emergency rescue operation for implementing the special order of the WPK Central Military Commission.\nHe was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee, first vice-president of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, Pak Jong Chon, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, Kang Sun Nam, minister of National Defence of the DPRK, and Ri Yong Gil, chief of the General Staff of the KPA.\nThere took place a ceremony of awarding order to the helicopter unit that performed distinguished military feats in the sacred struggle for defending the people.\nThe national anthem of the DPRK was played.\nKim Jong Unmade a rallying speech.\nIn the speech, he said:\nI wanted to proudly boast about the pilots of the helicopter unit who performed matchless feats in protecting our God-like people without an equal in the world, and out of this desire I have come to the unit on the way back from the site of repairing the flood damage. Holding a grand commendation ceremony and making the whole army learn from them and the world know about them represent the extent of the feats of the pilots and the height of the appreciation of the Party and the country.\nNo casualties occurred in the Sinuiju area, which suffered the greatest flood damage caused by the record heavy rainfall and the rapid increase in water inflow in the basin of the Amnok River. This fact cannot be expressed otherwise than a miracle. The service personnel of the Air Force demonstrated matchless combat efficiency in achieving feats by giving full play to their bravery in the face of the then dangerous weather conditions and to their expertise and perfectness in carrying out their successive missions.\nThey left another precious and honourable record that would go down in the history of distinguished military feats of our heroic army. I extend heartfelt thanks to all the service personnel of the Air Force, who protected the God-like people and firmly defended the people\u2019s trust in the Party and the government by piloting their aircraft through rain clouds and heavy rains at the risk of their lives.\nI am also thankful that all the pilots are safe although one helicopter crash-landed in an operation area on its mission.\nI also extend warm thanks to the combatants of the sharpshooter brigade of the Navy, maritime guard formation of the Border Guards and the General Reconnaissance Bureau who were involved in the rescue operation.\nThe pilots of the helicopter unit proved what the soldiers and the well-prepared unit, to be emulated by the entire army, should be like through its capability for fighting a war at the battlefield where their lives were at stake, not on a training ground for judging capability.\nSeeing the organized, professional and unhesitating combat actions of all the soldiers, who immediately launched into a rescue campaign in the unfamiliar flood-hit areas in bad weather conditions at night true to the order of the Party Central Committee, my heart grew warmer as I felt that I found a genuine model unit.\nI would like to speak highly specially of the combat spirit and deep ideological and moral world of the unit commander, who is able to stand in the vanguard before shouting an order. Our Party needs such a field commanding officer of abilities and action required by modern warfare. I was deeply moved to see him carrying out the successive and repeated missions of reconnaissance, rescue and search without showing any sign of getting tired that day. It is a real miracle to have saved more than 4 200 people within a few hours with the helicopters, totalling more than 5 000 people when those, rescued by other units which carried out their rescue mission on the water, are included.\nThese are undying feats to be described with the words heroic and miraculous as they are a success greater than shooting down 10, nay, 100 enemy aircraft and feats to be glorified and handed down in history for the character of the operation as a campaign for defending the people.\nAlthough the wonders done by heaven are constantly changing and no milestone exists in the vast open sky, our Air Force\u2019s skyway is the only one indicated by the Party and revolution. This is why the feats performed by our pilots are so honourable. I am of the belief that the pilots and all other officers and men of this unit will as ever firmly defend the cause of the Party and reliably safeguard the security of the airspace sovereignty of our state and the well-being of its people with ardent patriotism and loyalty and heroic fighting spirit.\nThe service personnel should raise more fiercely the flames of the revolution in training just as they were brave, skilled and unhesitating in the struggle for defending the people, so as to annihilate the enemy.\nThe enemy\u2019s rubbish media are spreading a false rumour that the number of casualties in our flood-hit areas is expected to be over 1 000 or 1 500 and that several helicopters are believed to have fallen on the rescue mission. Clear is the sinister purpose of those in Seoul obsessed about such a smear campaign.\nSaying that the enemy remain unchanged, he bitterly censured the inveterate habits and despicable nature of the ROK scum keen on a vicious smear campaign to disparage the DPRK and tarnish its image at any cost, and continued:\nWe will neither give up national defence for disaster relief or for the people's living nor pay less attention to their living for national defence.\nReferring to the future orientation of development of the Air Force,Kim Jong Unaffirmed that the people's Air Force would make a great contribution to ensuring national security and regional peace and stability, adding:\nThe people are our God. We should care about the inconvenience of the flood victims who are at evacuation areas even at this moment when boiling heat still rages. We should speed up the rehabilitation as much as possible. We should make the whole country brim with the communist trait of one for all and all for one the harder the times are, and in particular, our army should show utmost filial devotion to the people as befit their sons and daughters.\nExpressing his thanks again to the unit for having performed sacred feats in the campaign for defending the people, he ardently wished the heroic people's Air Force victory and glory.\nWhen his speech was over, the service personnel of the Air Force burst into thunderous cheers again.\nAll the participants expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Supreme Commander, who put them forward, who had only remained faithful to the mission of the sacred people's Air Force, as a source of pride of the Party and the state, and renewed their iron will to be always thoroughgoing and courageous in defending the sovereignty of the country and ensuring the safety and well-being of the people true to the slogan inscribed in their glorious colours.\nChoe Ryong Hae read out the decrees of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly of the DPRK on awarding the Order of Freedom and Independence 1st Class to the helicopter unit of the KPA Air Force and the title of DPRK Hero to its commander who had led the unit in the campaign for defending the people to achieve brilliant feats.\nKim Jong Unpersonally conferred the orders.\nHe affixed the Order of Freedom and Independence 1st Class to the colours of the unit.\nHe awarded the title of DPRK Hero, Gold Star Medal and Order of National Flag 1st Class to the commander of the unit.\nThe citation of the Supreme Commander of the armed forces of the DPRK was conferred on 47 pilots and flight engineers.\nThe officers and men of the Air Force broke into enthusiastic cheers, looking up with deep gratitude to the great brilliant commander who decorated their feats performed on the road of military service with the gold star while respectfully calling them the army of lifeguards of the Party Central Committee and the first death-defying corps in defending the revolution and the people.\nThe unit commander made an oath-taking speech on behalf of his unit.\nThe self-sacrificing devotion of the great father, who regards our people as part of his flesh and blood that can never be lost, constituted an inexhaustible driving force that encouraged us to brave downpour and strong wind and a key to the fighting efficiency that enabled us to bring about an unprecedented miracle in air rescue operation, he said, and made the following pledge: The red hawks of the brave Air Force of the DPRK will as ever fly along the route of loyalty and requital without even 0.001mm of deviation, cherishing the trust of the Supreme Commander and the Party Central Committee as their whole life.\nThe venue of the awards ceremony was filled with the militant enthusiasm of the participants to fully demonstrate the spiritual qualities and mettle of the people's Air Force in the struggle to death-defyingly defend the well-being, rights and interests of the state and the people by giving fuller play to the steadfast revolutionary faith, patriotic spirit and spirit of devoted service with which they have supported the ideas and cause of the great Party Central Committee in the vanguard.\nThere took place a march-past of the guard of honour of the KPA Air Force.\nKim Jong Unposed for a photo with the pilots, who performed distinguished feats in the operation for defending the people, with the glorious colours at the centre.\nHe repeatedly said with high appreciation that the steadfast officers and men of the Air Force, who share the steps of strenuous efforts and mind with the Supreme Commander to serve the people with absolute commitment, cherishing the outlook on the revolution and life that there is no greater happiness than the pride of sharing intention, will and practice with him, are a source of the highest pride of our Party and people, expressing expectation and belief that the pilots will steadily carry on the present honour with more brilliant feats.\nThe firm pledge of the air fighters to display the mettle of the WPK's red phoenix braving any flames and storm, cherishing the great love and trust shown byKim Jong Unas the mainstay of their faith, resounded far and wide in the sky of August along with the loud shouts of \"Kim Jong Un\" and \"Death-defying defence\".\nThat eveningKim Jong Unhosted a reception in congratulation of the unit\u2019s officers and men who received the orders of honour.\nLeading officials of the Party, government and military attended the reception and warmly congratulated the winners.\nThe reception was filled with the feelings of kinship and trust between the great brilliant commander and his bodyguards.\nKim Jong Un's congratulatory visit to the helicopter unit will be brilliantly recorded in the history of army building as an event filled with warm love and encouragement that put on the eminence of the times the brilliant tradition and ever-victorious militant spirit of the people's Air Force, which has always flied along the route of absolute loyalty and heroic military service to defend the country and the people, and powerfully inspired it to perform continuous feats. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 4 (KCNA) -- The External Policy Office of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, released the following press statement \"We will respond to hostile forces' any option with stronger counteraction\" on Saturday:\nThe security environment of the Korean peninsula and the region has been exposed to a serious threat, due to the reckless nuclear confrontation racket kicked up by the U.S. and the ROK military gangsters recently.\nThe war maniacs of the U.S. and the ROK staged from July 30 to August 1 the nuclear operation drill dubbed Iron Mace simulating a full-scale nuclear war under the pretext of countering the DPRK's \"use of nuclear weapons\" at the Phyongthaek U.S. military base in Kyonggi Province.\nThis shows that the nuclear war plan of the U.S. and the ROK, which have regularly modified and examined the nuclear strike plan targeting the DPRK since they formed the \"Nuclear Consultative Group\" according to the \"Washington Declaration\" in April last year, has entered the phase of actual and detailed execution.\nThe provocative acts of the U.S., which has plunged the worrisome security environment of the Korean peninsula into a more dangerous phase to persistently escalate the danger of a nuclear clash in the region, clearly indicate the very one to be held accountable for the ever-worsening regional situation.\nToday's world has faced the unprecedented danger of a nuclear war, for the U.S. has doggedly pursued its wild ambition for gaining the nuclear edge in disregard of global peace and stability and regional security environment.\nThe acting assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Defense recently unveiled a design to deploy more nuclear weapons and develop various nuclear strike means, accusing independent sovereign countries of posing \"threats.\"\nIn response to it, conservatives in the U.S. even call for deploying tactical nuclear weapons in the ROK and expanding the tactical nuclear warhead production capacity of the U.S.  They even make such an extremely risky assertion that the U.S. should exert all its national power on preparing for a war against independent sovereign countries.\nThe U.S. has annually and systematically increased expenditure on modernizing its nuclear forces, stepping up the development of such new strategic nuclear strike means as Columbia-class strategic nuclear submarine, new-type ICBM LGM-35A Sentinel and the sixth-generation nuclear strategic bomber B-21 Raider. It gets frantic in the development of new-type nuclear weapons, conducting high-powered bomb tests and sub-critical nuclear tests.\nAfter cooking up the \"nuclear operation guidelines\" with the ROK, the U.S. committed itself to providing Japan with \"extended deterrence\" including nuclear weapons, inveigling its vassal countries into the framework of a nuclear alliance.\nAll facts go to prove that the U.S. nuclear-based scheme to subdue the independent and sovereign states in the Korean peninsula, the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world is evolving in an extremely grave direction.\nOne side's such unilateral escalation of nuclear threat and provocative modification of nuclear posture stress the need for the other side to bolster up the self-defensive nuclear deterrence and perfect the preparations for a nuclear war.\nThe U.S. reckless nuclear confrontation racket makes clearer the DPRK's choice and goal for defending the security interests of the state and the regional peace and stability.\nIt is the constitutional duty of the nuclear forces of the DPRK to deter nuclear attacks of any forms and scales to be schemed or attempted by the hostile states, and to defend the national sovereignty and territorial integrity from present and future uncertain security environment.\nIf hostile states opt for making themselves and the world less secure, the DPRK is ready to take the most necessary measures to ensure its sovereignty and security interests and regional and global peace and stability.\nThe U.S. and its followers are bound to bear the whole responsibility for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their reckless option. -0-",

It gets frantic in the development of new-type nuclear weapons, conducting high-powered bomb tests and sub-critical nuclear tests.\nAfter cooking up the \"nuclear operation guidelines\" with the ROK, the U.S. committed itself to providing Japan with \"extended deterrence\" including nuclear weapons, inveigling its vassal countries into the framework of a nuclear alliance.\nAll facts go to prove that the U.S. nuclear-based scheme to subdue the independent and sovereign states in the Korean peninsula, the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world is evolving in an extremely grave direction.\nOne side's such unilateral escalation of nuclear threat and provocative modification of nuclear posture stress the need for the other side to bolster up the self-defensive nuclear deterrence and perfect the preparations for a nuclear war.\nThe U.S. reckless nuclear confrontation racket makes clearer the DPRK's choice and goal for defending the security interests of the state and the regional peace and stability.\nIt is the constitutional duty of the nuclear forces of the DPRK to deter nuclear attacks of any forms and scales to be schemed or attempted by the hostile states, and to defend the national sovereignty and territorial integrity from present and future uncertain security environment.\nIf hostile states opt for making themselves and the world less secure, the DPRK is ready to take the most necessary measures to ensure its sovereignty and security interests and regional and global peace and stability.\nThe U.S. and its followers are bound to bear the whole responsibility for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their reckless option. -0-",

It can never be justified in any case and with anything.\nThe Russian government said that any attempt of the Western countries to confiscate Russian assets will be branded as stealing and will not escape punishment and no matter what rhetoric they may make, theft will remain theft, too.\nThe unbiased world public censured it as a clear illegal one, expressing serious concern over the fact that it would be a bad precedent for the disposal of state assets in dispute and an act of harming international financial stability.\nBut the U.S. and the West are advertising their rare robbery as a well-intended act for \"peace and security\", claiming that emergency measures are necessary in the extraordinary period and there is no greater symbol than making Ukraine and the whole of Europe safer with the funds of the Kremlin.\nIs the robbery for \"peace and security\" being allowed to do?\nThere is no pretext for justifying robbery and theft in the world.\nIt is an open fact that the U.S. and the West were seeking Russia's overseas assets to fill up their financial resources which run out for the long-term crisis in Ukraine.\nAs recently disclosed by the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. national debt has reached the worst phase beyond 35 trillion US dollars and the other Western countries, too, are not placed in a position to look after others due to their poor economic situation.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine spends more than 136 million US dollars every day and more than 4 billion US dollars every month for military expenditure.\nThe Russian assets frozen by the West, which cannot but make every effort for running the Russian war machine, are no more than a lump of oily meat.\nIn order to calm down the internal differences in view and international legality at any cost, the U.S. and the West have thrust themselves into the robbery in group while competitively faking up legal frameworks for allowing the seizure of the assets of a sovereign state.\nThe EU decided to allocate 90 percent of the earnings of the frozen assets of the Central Bank of Russia to the supply of military assistance to Ukraine and the remaining 10 percent to other items. This clearly shows its real intention to prolong the bloody war and slaughter on the European Continent, not to end the war.\nNo matter how hard the U.S. and its followers may describe their act as one for \"peace in Ukraine\" and \"security in Europe\", they cannot conceal their atrocious nature turned into a worldwide gangster group. And it will be another evidence of proving their predatory, arrogant and shameless nature.\nThe world people are stunned by the ignorant and rude robbery of the U.S. and the West which is not the first and the last.\nThe U.S. and the West will have to pay dearly for their plunder, irrespective of international law, market rules, enemy or ally. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 5 (KCNA) -- On August 4Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and President of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, attended the ceremony of transferring and receiving new-type tactical ballistic missile system and made a speech.\nHe said:\nComrades,\nToday we have gathered for this characteristic ceremony to celebrate the transferring of new-type tactical weapons to our army.\nWe are now witnessing a moment of the course of our state's defence capability increasing day by day.\nRepresentatives of defence scientists and munitions industry workers, who have worked with devotion in the struggle to produce these tactical weapons of great military significance, which would fill up the major gaps in our state's defence capability and form a main force in our military forces,\nOfficers and soldiers of the frontline missile artillerymen\u2019s units, who will soon receive the new weapons,\nDear comrades,\nAs you see, we are now facing 250 new-type tactical ballistic missile launchers, which our munitions industry workers have produced by their own efforts and technology.\nThose weapons, lining up in columns in front of us, will be transferred to our army now and will play an important military role in the border areas of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\nThis of course means no more than attaining our first-stage goal of building missile forces in the first-line units on the front.\nEvery year we will show the whole world without filtering the procedure of the change of generations of our military hardware with new ones.\nIt is because this has enough special effect on deterring war.\nThe world is witnessing the course of development of our armed forces.\nWe have become able to take the operational initiative with the overwhelming attack forces and striking means superior to the enemy on all fronts, achieve the multifaceted nature of the spaces of firepower tasks and improve the practical effectiveness of the special physical strength, tactical nuke.\nI am very pleased to make public that an important item in the practical guidelines for building up the military capability, which was decided on at the Eighth Congress of our Party and the enlarged meetings of the Central Military Commission of the Party held during the eighth term of the Party Central Committee, has been brought to fruition.\nGreeting this moment that declares a great change in our armed forces and their prospective development, I, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, extend warm thanks to the workers, scientists and officials in the munitions industry, who have proudly carried out their revolutionary tasks of great strategic significance in steadily developing our state's self-reliant national defence capability.\nComrades,\nThanks to the firepower of this weapon system, presenting a threatening appearance for the first time since the founding of our country and army, we have become able to possess a sure and overwhelming strength with which to contain the enemy's reckless provocative moves against us.\nThe fact that these military hardware of a new generation have been produced in less than one year in the circumstances, in which the hostile forces' challenges and moves of blockade persisted on an unprecedentedly extreme degree, adequately demonstrates the potential and might of our self-reliant defence industry.\nBy waging a heroic production struggle and presenting the products encapsulating their pure conscience and ennobling outlook on life, our munitions industry workers fully demonstrated the faith and revolutionary nature inherent in them.\nWhat I am most pleased with today is that I have confirmed once again the ennobling spiritual world of the munitions industry workers, who clearly remember their lineage and origin and are faithful and dignified in remaining true to their honourable original name of successors to the Kunjari spirit.\nThe strength of our defence industry is not merely the might of our defence science. Rather, it is a strength of the absolute loyalty these workers are displaying in unconditionally and perfectly carrying out the Party's decisions and plans from the standpoint that doing so is their ennobling duty.\nAbsolute, unconditional and perfect implementation is our munitions industry workers' invariable raison d'etre, lifeline and unique quality.\nTrue to the orders of the Party Central Military Commission, the workers, scientists and officials in the munitions industry have made strenuous efforts to manufacture hundreds of cutting-edge military hardware, thereby fulfilling the strategic plan for developing our state's war deterrent to the highest level possible. By doing so, they have instilled an overwhelming sense of dignity and honour in all the patriotic people of this country, and inspired them with renewed confidence in final victory. I highly appreciate them and offer positive encouragement to them in their efforts for more proud successes.\nComrades,\nAs the relationship of the U.S.-led alliance is, in terms of its nature and character, evolving into a nuclear-based military bloc, the military security environment surrounding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is facing drastic changes, both strategically and structurally.\nThis highlights the fact that our state has no reason to rest content with its current level of war deterrent.\nTo look back on the past five years, we can see that the concept of nuclear has been associated with every military action targeting the DPRK taken by the United States, and now its vassal states have grown reckless enough to share its nukes.\nThis situation demands that we keep accelerating the development of our Republic's armed forces for maintaining their supremacy, and also of the self-reliant defence industry that provides solid support to this end.\nGenuine peace can be guaranteed only by the build-up of immense strength.\nNegotiations and confrontation are among our options, but we must be more thoroughly prepared to cope with the latter--this is the review and conclusion we have derived from the 30-odd years of dealing with the United States, and it is the keynote of our consistent policy towards the United States.\nThe fact that the United States and the groups of its top-class stooges are overstepping the mark in their outrageous military manoeuvres provides evidence for the justice of our cause, and this compels us to bolster up our self-defensive military capability more perfectly and rapidly. This will inevitably hasten the failure, shame and destruction on the part of the enemy.\nThe United States we are now confronting is by no means an administration that remains in power for a tenure of some years, but a hostile state that our descendants, too, will have to counter generation after generation. This fact testifies to the inevitability of the steady improvement of our defence capability.\nWe should possess the capability to cope on our own initiative with new, potential dangers to our security, as well as the various imminent threats by the United States. This is a crucial task for providing a long-term guarantee for defending the sovereignty, security, interests and territorial integrity of our state.\nAt present, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has built up its national system of nuclear forces, with which to promptly counter any type of threatening actions by the nuclear-armed enemy states, and we have made steady efforts to make the nuclear forces fully ready for action.\nHowever, witnessing the rapidly-changing global security environment and the reckless expansion of the U.S.-led military bloc system, we have come to a conclusion that the nuclear forces of our state and its nuclear posture should be more thoroughgoing and perfect, and we feel its necessity every day and every minute.\nOur mightiness is not what it is now, but it lies in our relentless pursuit of mightiness.\nStagnation in military supremacy is just the beginning of inferiority in defence capability.\nWe must never forget that if we rest content with the present level of supremacy that has taken so much cost for us to reach, we should pay more later.\nClear is our standpoint in coping with the U.S. moves to aggravate the situation.\nIf it continues attempting to jeopardize the security of the region in disregard of our repeated warnings, we will make the United States acutely aware that there will be fatal consequences for its own security.\nI make it clear once again: Whether engaged in negotiations or confrontation, possessing a great military strength is an obligation and right a sovereign state must never neglect or budge on at any moment.\nUnless an end is put to the nuclear threat against us, and as long as there exist the imperialist forces that resort to nukes as a means of their tyranny, there will never be a moment\u2019s halt or a breathing space on our journey for the consolidation of our nuclear war deterrent.\nOur strength will continue to evolve, and our military supremacy will deny its limits forever.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea will resolutely face both imminent and potential challenges by attaining a more refined and improved posture of its nuclear forces as soon as possible to contain any nuclear threats and defend itself from them.\nGiven the fact that the United States and its vassal forces have been tightening the screw on the DPRK by resorting to military means,Kim Jong Unsaid, it has been an indisputable option for the DPRK to make sustained efforts to increase its defence capability.\nHe went on:\nBuilding up the nuclear war deterrent and developing it to the highest level possible is the best option for effectively confronting the nuclear blackmail and multi-faceted isolation schemes by the United States and for earmarking a larger investment for economic development and improvement of the people's living standards--this is the principled standpoint we have consistently maintained over the last ten or so years since we proclaimed the new line of promoting the country's economic construction and building up its nuclear forces simultaneously, and its validity and viability have been clearly proved through practice.\nWe should always bear this in mind, and work hard to achieve the goals of the five-year strategy for defence development advanced by the eighth-term Central Committee of the Party, uncompromisingly and faultlessly, thoroughly and completely.\nThe munitions industry must never compromise on its absolute mission that increased production of military hardware provides a sure guarantee for safeguarding the country's sovereignty and enhancing its prestige; it should work hard to achieve greater and prouder successes in attaining the Party's objectives for modernizing the defence industry and in carrying out its task of producing weapons of the Juche type.\nThe army units, to which the new-type weapon system is to be transferred, should master the new system as early as possible, actively organize and conduct training in a real-war atmosphere to operate it so effectively as to maximize its efficiency in battle, and maintain a prompt and proper operational posture. In this way, they can creditably implement their military duties to deter war and take the initiative.\nWhat our proud new missile units will receive today is not merely the new weapons.\nLike all other weapons of ours, these embody our people's firm will to put an end to the threats of aggression against our Republic, as well as their spirit of self-respect to make theirs an invincible country that no force will dare to attack and their desire to develop it into a powerful nation.\nWe will continue to develop and produce more powerful and sophisticated military hardware of our own style and deploy them for action, thus ensuring that the People's Army keeps gaining in strength over time.\nThe Party Central Committee will always accompany and properly lead our munitions industry workers, both faithful and dependable, on this responsible and important journey.\nComrades,\nLet us bear in mind once again that absolute and matchless self-defence capability provides a sure guarantee for independence, justice and peace.\nEver-developing, inexhaustible\u00a0strength is fundamental to our eternal victory, genuine peace, happiness and safety.\nLet us all strive undauntedly and achieve constant transformations and innovative successes for the independent development of our great state and a peaceful and prosperous new life of our people. -0-",

Party members to always find themselves earlier than others in the most difficult and seriously damaged areas to inject vitality into the advancing ranks by playing a bold vanguard role, he stressed.\nThere is nothing impossible for us to do as the heroic example of the air force fighters, who performed miraculous feats by rescuing the people in danger to death-defyingly implement the order of the Party Central Committee, encourages us, and the spirit of the division of the Party members from the capital city, who went through thick and thin true to the call of the Party, exists, he said, calling for glorifying their noble title and honor as members of the WPK by setting a pioneer example through death-defying practice.\nSaying that the struggle of the WPK members will bring

This is aimed at turning the UN Command into the second NATO of Asian version by dragging its allies and thus militarily deter the DPRK and its neighboring countries.\nGermany's improper act is again reminiscent of its inglorious past in which it plunged mankind into the bloodbath of the Second World War and inflicted untold misfortune and pain upon mankind in the last century.\nGermany should bear in mind that its military intervention in the Korean peninsula, the biggest hotbed in the world, will act as a vicious factor in keeping up its security and image.\nGermany's entry into the UN Command is clearly not helpful to maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula and the rest of the region but an act which has a serious negative effect on the development interests of the DPRK.\nThe present ever-escalating military confrontation on the Korean peninsula demands the DPRK take more thorough measures for bolstering up its self-defensive capabilities to defend the sovereignty, security and interests of the state.\nThe DPRK Foreign Ministry notifies in advance that Germany's entry into the UN Command will inevitably aggravate the military and political situation on the Korean peninsula and the rest of the region, and that Germany will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. -0-",

Britain and other Western countries joined in it.\nBut the Middle East resistance forces, enraged by Israel\u2019s brutal massacres and the U.S. and the West patronizing them, have conducted fierce military activities, which are growing stronger day by day.\nIt is the Yemen resistance forces that have emerged as the main rival driving the U.S. and the West into a defensive in the waters of the Red Sea.\nThe resistance forces conducted military attacks to shoot down six MQ-9 Reapers, the air combat drones the U.S. is pride of, in six months and the myth of the U.S. \"mightiness\" has been completely thrown into the Red Sea.\nThey are still pressurizing the U.S. and the West, saying that their military attack will continue to increase unless Israel stops the mass killing.\nIn this regard, the international community is calling the U.S. and the Western military operations of the \"defender of prosperity\" in the waters of the Red Sea, the hopeless ones like a \"whack-a-mole game\".\nEven the U.S. military experts deplored the U.S. navy which has faced the most persistent and difficult battle after the Second World War.\nThe commanding officer of a destroyer of the U.S. forces expressed his extreme fears, saying people do not know that we are carrying out the missions under deadly threat and if we make one mistake of judgment, we are hit by missile.\nThe frightened guys are frequently attacking each other.\nIn February an escort ship of Germany, which claimed to be the latest warship, misjudged the U.S. navy's drone as enemy and launched two interceptor missiles. But they failed to reach their target and dropped into the sea. This incident clearly showed the confusion caused by fear among armed interventionists in the waters of the Red Sea and the weakness of their \u201cultra-modern equipment\u201d.\nIt is by no means accidental that the international community comments that the huge naval forces of the U.S. and the West which are not seizing a naval route against resistance forces, not a regular army, are below the level.\nBut it is one reason to consider.\nAnother reason is that the will of the anti-U.S. resistance in the Middle East not to tolerate any more U.S. acts of imprudently thrusting in its head and going arbitrary in the region is resulting in overcoming the \"superiority of force\".\nThe reality goes to prove that the Western forces headed by the U.S. that are engrossed in war and massacre in different parts of the world are bound hands and feet by the anti-U.S. sacred war in the regions for defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 6 (KCNA) -- The waters of the Red Sea is becoming a \"maze\" for the U.S. and Western armed interventionists who have thronged there.\nAfter the outbreak of the Middle East crisis, the U.S. has deployed nuclear carrier and other strategic assets in the waters of the Red Sea to destroy the Middle East resistance forces against the Israeli Zionists and, at the same time, played a role of \"protector\" supporting the human killing of its servant. Britain and other Western countries joined in it.\nBut the Middle East resistance forces, enraged by Israel\u2019s brutal massacres and the U.S. and the West patronizing them, have conducted fierce military activities, which are growing stronger day by day.\nIt is the Yemen resistance forces that have emerged as the main rival driving the U.S. and the West into a defensive in the waters of the Red Sea.\nThe resistance forces conducted military attacks to shoot down six MQ-9 Reapers, the air combat drones the U.S. is pride of, in six months and the myth of the U.S. \"mightiness\" has been completely thrown into the Red Sea.\nThey are still pressurizing the U.S. and the West, saying that their military attack will continue to increase unless Israel stops the mass killing.\nIn this regard, the international community is calling the U.S. and the Western military operations of the \"defender of prosperity\" in the waters of the Red Sea, the hopeless ones like a \"whack-a-mole game\".\nEven the U.S. military experts deplored the U.S. navy which has faced the most persistent and difficult battle after the Second World War.\nThe commanding officer of a destroyer of the U.S. forces expressed his extreme fears, saying people do not know that we are carrying out the missions under deadly threat and if we make one mistake of judgment, we are hit by missile.\nThe frightened guys are frequently attacking each other.\nIn February an escort ship of Germany, which claimed to be the latest warship, misjudged the U.S. navy's drone as enemy and launched two interceptor missiles. But they failed to reach their target and dropped into the sea. This incident clearly showed the confusion caused by fear among armed interventionists in the waters of the Red Sea and the weakness of their \u201cultra-modern equipment\u201d.\nIt is by no means accidental that the international community comments that the huge naval forces of the U.S. and the West which are not seizing a naval route against resistance forces, not a regular army, are below the level.\nBut it is one reason to consider.\nAnother reason is that the will of the anti-U.S. resistance in the Middle East not to tolerate any more U.S. acts of imprudently thrusting in its head and going arbitrary in the region is resulting in overcoming the \"superiority of force\".\nThe reality goes to prove that the Western forces headed by the U.S. that are engrossed in war and massacre in different parts of the world are bound hands and feet by the anti-U.S. sacred war in the regions for defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 7 (KCNA) -- Recorded in the sacred history of the Korean revolution shining with the indomitable and vigorous advance and successive victories are the precious feats of the patriotic youth who have accelerated the drive for the prosperity of the country, dedicating their youth to the sacred cause of bringing earlier the bright future.\nThe ardent pioneering spirit and matchless charging spirit of the young vanguard of Juche Korea are further developing into the most leading and revolutionary advance and heroic struggle to be praised forever along with the great era ofKim Jong Un.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Un, who firmly believes and puts forward the young people always as the advancing group, wing and special detachment of the Workers' Party of Korea, designated the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade to undertake the rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in the flood-hit areas in Sinuiju City and Uiju County of North Phyongan Province.\nVowing to perform again miraculous and heroic feats through a gigantic brave offensive, glorifying the dignity and honor of the Korean youth, in response to the call ofKim Jong Un, many young vanguard members have volunteered for rehabilitation projects in flood-hit areas like the defenders of the country who had voluntarily gone to the front in the 1950s with surging patriotism.\nA departure ceremony of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade to be dispatched to the rehabilitation campaign areas in North Phyongan Province took place in Pyongyang, the capital city, on August 6.\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the DPRK, attended the ceremony.\nThe plaza of the April 25 House of Culture, where ardent young people gathered before departing for the forefront of defending the people, was filled with their deep reverence forKim Jong Un, who has led the young people to add lustre to their honourable title as the socialist patriotic youth, letting them stand in the vanguard of the struggle for the rosy future of a prospering power, and with their fervent will to live up to his such trust.\nWhen he arrived, all the participants burst into stormy cheers of \"Hurrah!\"\nAll the participants paid the highest tribute and glory to the great leader who has brought up the young people to be the most vigorous unit of society that adds fresh strength to the country and creates new changes and to be the successors of the revolution who remain faithful to the cause of the WPK.\nHe extended militant greetings to the young people full of high enthusiasm to create new legendary tales about the heroic youth in the sites of the gigantic rehabilitation campaign, launched in a northwestern region of the country, by inheriting the proud tradition of responding to the call of the Party with loyalty and patriotic practice.\nPresent there were Jo Yong Won, Kim Jae Ryong and Pak Thae Song, secretaries of the WPK

vanguard of the revolution and the pluck and spirit peculiar to the brave and ardent young people,Kim Jong Unhighly appreciated the young people for responding to the calls of the country, the people and the revolution with enthusiastic volunteering and courageous attitude once again.\nAfter a decision was made some days ago to dispatch the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade to the housing construction in the flood-hit areas of Sinuiju City and Uiju County, nearly 300 000 young people have volunteered to go to the areas of recovery from flood damage in less than a week, upon receiving the decision of the Party and the ensuing appeal of the Central Committee of the youth league, he said, adding that such explosive volunteering enthusiasm can never be found in any other countries and he would like to speak to the world proudly that our country have such great young people.\nSaying that our young people have surely overcome obstacles to their advance by dint of struggle and preserved and glorified their true appearance with enthusiasm, wisdom and practice, he pointed out that their such deeds originate from their strong faith to share their destiny with socialism forever

revolution.\nIt is the fact to be really proud of that a large contingent of such laudable and stalwart young people, who regard the hardship of the country and people's misfortune as their own pains, fervently support the determination of the Party Central Committee and deem it their revolutionary task, adds strength to the Party and the country, strikingly demonstrating the strong spirit of the Korean youth with their hearts burning with fervent enthusiasm, he said, extending warm thanks to the commanding officers and members of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade and all other young people and students.\nHe also offered his warm greetings to the parents, who sent their dear sons and daughters to the grand construction sites without hesitation, and to the organizations and officials of the Socialist Patriotic Youth League at all levels that have inspired many young people to volunteer through an earnest appeal.\nSaying that the enterprising spirit peculiar to the youth and their sky-high spirit and ever-growing vigour serve as an incomparably precious and powerful engine for our Party and people in attaining high goals and tiding over impending difficulties, he recalled that the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade and the Socialist Patriotic Youth League have successfully built the edifices reflective of their merits every year, proving through an indomitable struggle, eagerly waged by them for over ten years, how the spirit of loyalty and patriotism bequeathed by the martyrs is inherited.\nNoting that the flood damage restoration work, to be launched in the basin of the Amnok River, would be a gigantic revolutionary construction campaign for giving a complete facelift to a part of our territory, he expressed the conviction that the members and officials of the youth shock brigade and the youth league would fully display their revolutionary traits and matchless creativity as befitting the ones of a vanguard unit for socialist construction and a special attachment dispatched by the Party, and indicated militant tasks to be fulfilled by them.\nSaying that the enterprise and courage of the youth add vitality and dynamism to our society and their perspiration, exploits, strength and courage will increase the wealth of our country and people and further accelerate the advance of our revolution, he stressed that their youthful vigour and burning enthusiasm that will sweep the new creation campaign site, strong courage and bold offensive unhesitatingly braving difficulties, impeccable sense of responsibility and pure conscience deserving people's appreciation will shine as the heroic youth's typical characteristics representing the times.\nHe proudly said the dignity and prestige of our Party will be everlasting as a banner of invincibility and the lifeline of the Korean revolution will remain invulnerable for all ages, thanks to the faithful support by the revolutionary and patriotic youth organizations and young people with potential for attaining any demanding goals without fail, possessed of matchless bravery for tackling any trials and hardship.\nEarnestly hoping that the young volunteers would return home in good health with the pride of having performed great feats to be etched in history, true to the expectations of their parents, siblings, teachers, organizations and comrades, he fervently appealed them to advance toward a victory, demonstrating the dignity, mettle and bravery of the honorable Korean youth.\nAll the participants raised stormy cheers, filled with a steel-strong will to add lustre to the patriotic spirit, heroism and great honor of the young vanguard with signal achievements by building a happy land of wonders to be envied by the world and another proud monument to the youth without fail in the natural disaster-stricken areas through an intensive struggle in hearty response to the calls and expectations of the Party and the revolution.\nRyu Chol Jin, chief of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade, and Sung Hyok, a brigade commander of the High-Speed Youth Shock Brigade, made oath-taking speeches.\nThe speakers said that the respected fatherly Marshal\nKim Jong Unbestowed on the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade such great trust and honor as designating it to stand in the vanguard of the sacred struggle for eradicating the misfortune of the natural disaster-stricken people as early as possible.\nThey referred to the deep loving care shown byKim Jong Unwho unveiled a grand plan for providing the people with more excellent dwellings.\nThey expressed their will to complete all structures as monumental edifices to be proud of even in the distant future and present them to the Party and the people by displaying utmost sincerity and patriotism, mindful of the Marshal's ardent call for courageously turning out again in tiding over the crisis and performing miraculous successes.\nA letter of pledge to the respected fatherly Marshal was read out.\nAll the commanding officers and members of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade made a solemn pledge to successfully build the people\u2019s dwellings to be a new standard and model of regional rejuvenation, fully reflective of the appearance of an ever-developing highly civilized, prosperous and powerful socialist nation, in the flood-stricken areas, as timetabled by the Party, by dint of the indomitable heroic youth spirit, collective innovations and unequalled charge they displayed in the Paektu area and the capital city construction.\nKim Jong Unreceived a report from the chairman of the Central Committee of the Socialist Patriotic Youth League on the departure of the shock brigade.\nThere took place a march-past of the members of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade on departure.\nThe youth vanguard, filled with the single mind to demonstrate once again to the world the courage and pluck of doing anything determined by the Party unconditionally, took dynamic steps toward a new site of creation.\nThey were filled with the unshakable faith and will to translate the grandiose plan of the Party Central Committee into a brilliant reality with the patriotic zeal, indefatigable fighting will, inexhaustible strength and spirit of indomitable offensive peculiar to the Korean youth.\nKim Jong Unwarmly waved his hands for a while toward the marching ranks of the trustworthy and praiseworthy main unit of the youth representing the rosy future of the country.\nThe meeting was a great prelude to the dynamic advance of the young socialist builders, who will perform heroic feats in a gigantic struggle to be specially recorded in the history of the glorious Korean youth movement, as befitting the young vanguard in the great era ofKim Jong Un. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 7 (KCNA) -- Recorded in the sacred long course of the Korean revolution shining with indomitable and courageous advance and successive victories are the precious services and feats of the patriotic youth who have pressed ahead with the drive for the prosperity of the country, devoting their hot blood to the sacred cause of bringing earlier the bright future.\nThe ardent pioneering spirit and matchless charging spirit of the young vanguard of Juche Korea are further developing into the most active and revolutionary advance and heroic struggle to be praised forever along with the great era ofKim Jong Un.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Un, who always firmly believes and puts forward the young people as the advance group, wing and special detachment of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea, called the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade to the rehabilitation projects in the flood-hit areas in the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County of North Phyongan Province.\nA large number of young vanguard members have volunteered for the project sites, vowing to create another legendary tale of miraculous and heroic feats through a courageous mass campaign, staking the dignity and honour of the Korean youth, in response to the call ofKim Jong Un, and they are burning with the patriotic zeal of the defenders of the country who voluntarily went to the front in the 1950s.\nA departure ceremony of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade to be dispatched to the rehabilitation campaign areas in North Phyongan Province took place in the capital city of Pyongyang on August 6.\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the DPRK, attended the ceremony.\nThe plaza of the April 25 House of Culture, where the ardent young people gathered before departing for the forefront for the defence of the people, was filled with their deep reverence forKim Jong Un, who is leading the young men and women of the country to add lustre to their honourable appellation of socialist patriotic youth, putting them forward in the vanguard of the struggle for the rosy future of a thriving power, and with their fervent will to live up to his trust.\nWhen he arrived, all the participants burst into stormy cheers of \u201cHurrah!\u201d\nAll the participants paid the highest tribute and glory to the great leader, who is bringing up the young people to be the most vigorous of the social forces that injects fresh strength into the country and creates new changes and to be the successors of the revolution who loyally support the cause of the WPK.\nKim Jong Unextended militant greetings to the young people, who were full of high enthusiasm to create another legendary tale of the heroic youth at the sites of gigantic rehabilitation campaign, which was launched in the northwestern region of the country, by inheriting the proud tradition of responding to the call of the Party with loyalty and patriotic practice.\nPresent there were Jo Yong Won, Kim Jae Ryong and Pak Thae Song, secretaries of the WPK Central Committee, Ju Chang Il and Kim Jong Sun, department directors of the WPK Central Committee, Mun Chol, chairman of the Central Committee of the youth league, officials of the youth league, commanding officers and members of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade, and other young people and students.\nThe national anthem of the DPRK was played.\nKim Jong Unmade a rallying speech for the young people.\nExpressing his pleasure of seeing the young revolutionaries filled with the steel-strong spirit becoming the reliable reserves of the Party and the vanguard of the revolution and the pluck and mettle peculiar to the brave and ardent young people,Kim Jong Unhighly appreciated the young people for responding to the calls of the country, the people and the revolution with enthusiastic volunteering and courageous attitude once again, adding:\nIn less than a week after a decision was made by the Party to dispatch the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade to the housing construction in the flood-hit areas in the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County and the subsequent appeal by the Central Committee of the youth league, nearly 300 000 young people have volunteered to go to the areas of recovery from flood damage. Such explosive volunteering enthusiasm can never be found in any other countries. I would like to speak to the world proudly that our country has such great young people.\nOur young people have preserved and glorified their true appearance with enthusiasm, wisdom and practice by overcoming the obstacles on the road of their advance by dint of struggle. Such deeds of theirs originate from their strong faith to share their destiny with socialism forever and are a manifestation of their beautiful outlook on life, with which they find the honour and worth of their life in their ardent love for the country and dedication to the Party and the revolution.\nIt is the fact to be really proud of that a large contingent of such laudable and stalwart young people, who regard the hardship of the country and the people\u2019s misfortune as their own pains, fervently support the determination of the Party Central Committee and deem it their revolutionary task, adds strength to the Party and the country, powerfully demonstrating the stout mettle of the Korean youth with their hearts burning with fervent enthusiasm, he said, and extended warm thanks to the commanding officers and members of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade and all other young people and students.\nHe also offered his warm greetings to the parents, who sent their dear sons and daughters to the grand construction sites without hesitation, and to the organizations and officials of the Socialist Patriotic Youth League at all levels that have inspired many young people to volunteer through an earnest appeal.\nHe then continued:\nThe enterprising spirit and soaring mettle peculiar to the youth and their ever-growing vigour serve as an incomparably precious and powerful engine for our Party and people in attaining high goals and tiding over impending difficulties. The Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade and the Socialist Patriotic Youth League have wonderfully built the edifices reflective of their merits every year for over ten years, proving through an indomitable struggle of their own choice how the spirit of loyalty and patriotism bequeathed by their forerunners is inherited.\nThe rehabilitation work, to be launched in the basin of the Amnok River, would be a gigantic construction campaign for completely renovating a part of our territory, which is equivalent to bringing about a transformation. I am convinced that the members and officials of the youth shock brigade and the youth league will fully display their revolutionary traits and matchless creative abilities as befitting the members of a vanguard unit for socialist construction and a special detachment dispatched by the Party.\nAfter indicating the militant tasks they should fulfill,Kim Jong Unwent on:\nThe enterprising spirit and courage of the youth will add vitality and dynamism to our society, their sweats and exploits will increase the wealth of our country and people and their strength and courage will further accelerate the advance of our revolution. Their youthful vigour and burning enthusiasm that will sweep the new theatre of creation, their indomitable courage and bold offensive that know no hesitation in the face of difficulties, and their impeccable sense of responsibility and pure conscience that deserve people\u2019s appreciation will soon shine as the heroic youth\u2019s typical characteristics representing the times.\nThe dignity and prestige of our Party will be everlasting as an ever-victorious banner and the lifeline of the Korean revolution will be firmly carried forward for all ages as the Party is faithfully supported by the revolutionary and patriotic youth organization and young people that have potential for attaining any demanding goals without fail with matchless bravery for tackling any trials and hardship.\nKim Jong Un, after earnestly requesting that the young volunteers should return home in good health with the pride of having performed great feats to be etched in history, true to the expectations of their parents, siblings, teachers, organizations and comrades, fervently appealed to them to advance toward victory, demonstrating the dignity, mettle and courage of the honourable Korean youth.\nAll the participants raised stormy cheers, filled with a steel-strong will to add lustre to the patriotic fighting spirit, heroism and precious honour of the young vanguard with signal achievements by building a wonderland of happiness to be envied by the world and another proud monument to the youth without fail in the disaster-stricken areas through an indefatigable struggle in hearty response to the call and expectations of the Party and the revolution.\nRyu Chol Jin, commander of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade, and Sung Hyok, commander of a regiment of the High-Speed Youth Shock Brigade, made oath-taking speeches.\nThe speakers said that the respected fatherly MarshalKim Jong Unbestowed on the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade such great trust and honour as putting it forward in the vanguard of the worthwhile struggle for removing the misfortune of the disaster-stricken people as early as possible.\nThey referred to the deep loving care shown byKim Jong Un, who unfolded a grand plan for providing the people with a foundation for a happier life.\nThey expressed their determination to complete all structures as monumental edifices to be proud of even in the distant future and present them to the Party and the people by displaying utmost sincerity and patriotism, mindful ofKim Jong Un\u2019s ardent call for courageously turning out again to tide over the crisis and performing miraculous successes.\nA letter of pledge toKim Jong Unwas read out.\nAll the commanding officers and members of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade made a solemn pledge to successfully build the people\u2019s houses to be a new standard and model of regional rejuvenation, fully reflective of the appearance of an ever-developing highly civilized, prosperous and powerful socialist nation, in the flood-stricken areas according to the timetable set by the Party, by dint of the indomitable heroic youth spirit, collective innovation and unequalled charge they displayed in the Paektu area and in the capital city construction.\nKim Jong Unreceived a report from the chairman of the Central Committee of the Socialist Patriotic Youth League on the departure of the shock brigade.\nThere took place a march-past of the members of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade on departure.\nThe youth vanguard, filled with the single mind to demonstrate once again to the whole world the courage and pluck of doing without fail what the Party is determined to do, took dynamic steps toward new sites of creation.\nThey were filled with the unshakable faith and resolve to translate the grand plan of the Party Central Committee into a brilliant reality with the patriotic zeal, indefatigable will, inexhaustible strength and spirit of indomitable offensive peculiar to the Korean youth.\nKim Jong Unwarmly waved his hands for long toward the marching ranks of the trustworthy and praiseworthy main unit of the youth representing the rosy future of the country.\nThe departure ceremony constituted a great prelude to the dynamic advance of the young socialist builders, who will write with dignity another page of gigantic struggle and heroic feats to be specially recorded in the history of the glorious movement of the Korean youth, as befitting the young vanguard in the great era ofKim Jong Un. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- The sacred leadership of the great father, who with warm love and ennobling spirit of making devoted service for the people as his natural character, continues the long journey of devoted service for their wellbeing while dedicating his tireless thinking and efforts to the sake of the people all the time, has touched the flood-stricken people again, redoubling their confidence in and optimism about the future.\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, visited the flood-hit area in Uiju County of North Phyongan Province again on August 8 and 9 and took important measures for rehabilitation.\nHe, who pioneered an honorable campaign for providing the homeless people in the disaster-stricken areas with fine homes as soon as possible, visited again the flood victims of Uiju County on August 8.\nHe was accompanied by Jo Yong Won, Pak Jong Chon, Kim Jae Ryong, Ju Chang Il and Han Kwang Sang, leading officials of the WPK Central Committee.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Unwas greeted on the spot by Ri Hi Yong, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, the chairman of the provincial people's committee, the chief secretary of the Uiju County Party Committee and the chairman of the county people's committee.\nOn a hillock near a bank of the River Amnok overlooking the inundated island of Uiju County, he learned in detail about the specific conditions of the flooded area whose configuration begins to surface, and gave important instructions for rehabilitation.\nHe stressed the need to expand and propel the rehabilitation in a forward-looking and development-oriented way from the viewpoint that the rehabilitation is not only an undertaking for eradicating the aftermath of natural disaster but also a crucial issue of implementing the Party's far-reaching regional development programme.\nCalling for decisively raising the water-passage capacity in order to tackle the chronic vulnerability of the area that turns into a \"reservoir\" in downpour, he instructed the hydraulic engineering and designing sectors to take practical measures after jointly examining in a scientific way the current state of a river bank and the flood-prevention capacity of Uiju County which is bound to suffer flood damage due to the growing water level of the River Amnok.\nSaying that a radical change should be made in building a highly-civilized and fashionable residential district as good as the ones in city, occasioned by the construction of new dwelling houses in Uiju County, he called for building an ideal \"rural cultural city,\" where all amenities related to urban management, ranging from the supply of electricity and drinking water to sewage disposal, are perfectly provided.\nThen, he visited tents being used by flood victims as temporary dwellings and warmly consoled them.\nThe flood victims, unexpectedly seeingKim Jong Unwho visited their quarters in sweltering weather, broke into cheers of \"Hurrah!\" in tears of great excitement.\nThey paid tribute to him out of grateful feelings, looking up in tears to the father of a large socialist family, who had driven his way through rough waters to visit the flood-stricken areas and stayed there for a long time to rescue all of them from critical danger some days before, and even visited the tents where they live to show paternal affection that day.\nSitting knee to knee with flood victims,Kim Jong Untook meticulous care of their living, warmly asking them whether they had something inconvenient, how their meals were provided and if there were any ill persons.\nThey replied that they have nothing inconvenient as all necessary amenities have been provided thanks to his boundless love and the whole country renders all-out assistance, expressing in an excited tone their single desire to live up to his great benevolence.\nTelling them that it would be so hard for them to live away from home, he called on them to endure such pain a little more until the day when a paradise will be built on the ruins left by the natural disaster to provide them with a better life. He thanked them for invariably believing in our Party, saying rehabilitation doesn't matter as there exists such deep trust.\nFeeding children with confectionary he personally brought and putting lovely clothes on them, he said that seeing children he felt really encouraged and more deeply awakened to the sense of the duty he assumed to make the country stronger for the rising generations.\nFeeling the warm parental affection by the fatherly leader, who talked with them for a long time despite sultry weather, warmly taking their hands to console them and redouble their confidence and courage, flood victims hardly repressed their great emotion and thrust themselves into his embrace, raising stormy cheers in tears.\nFlood victims followed him step by step, reluctant to part from him. Telling them to go back, he promised to visit them again the next day\nHe met flood victims of Uiju County again on August 9 to clarify our Party and government's stand related to rehabilitation, take crucial measures and console them.\nHe made sure that aid materials prepared by the Party Central Committee for the flood victims of Sinuiju City and Uiju County were conveyed to them by his private train.\nHe also authorized the members of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee to convey the aid materials to the flood victims in Jagang and Ryanggang provinces on the spot.\nCadres of the Party Central Committee handed over the aid materials to the flood victims.\nThe flood victims of Uiju County, who received the aid materials associated with his warm care, raised loud cheers of \"Hurrah!\" in floods of tears, overwhelmed by deep gratitude, great happiness and high excitement.\nKim Jong Unshowed warm parental care for children, warmly hugging them in new clothes, caressing their hair and talking with them in whispers.\nHe made a consolatory speech before the flood victims.\nNoting that he came again to acquaint himself in more detail about their living conditions on the spot, reassign a series of tasks related to the recovery work and take crucial state measures helpful to the victims in addition, he said that he felt much relieved and greatly encouraged to see all of them living in good health without any inconvenience.\nPointing out that the people constitute the foundation and pillar of the Party and the state, the starting point and the focus of all their activities, he said that he takes pride in the people absolutely and unconditionally believing in the Party and the government even in the period of disaster-brought hardship. He told them about the important measures to be taken, clarifying the stand of the Party and the government on the issue of promoting the flood victims' living and rehabilitation.\nRecalling that the Party and the state concentrate their efforts on the rehabilitation campaign, he said that strong construction forces, including service personnel of the People's Army and young people, had already been deployed and transport of rehabilitation materials is underway under an emergency system.\nThe most urgent issue, arising in the period of two or three months until the housing construction is completed and their living stabilized, is the one of life and education of children and students, he said, adding that childcare, edification and education are the primary state affairs never to be given up in any emergency situation.\nHe announced such an important measure as putting into operation an emergency system to bring all the children and students in the families of flood victims in North Phyongan, Jagang and Ryanggang provinces to Pyongyang to take educational care of them in a secure and convenient environment at the expenses of the state and in its direct charge until the rehabilitation finishes, and rendering state-backed protection and care to the old and sick persons, honoured disabled soldiers and baby mums after bringing them to Pyongyang.\nHe said that he leaves everything to individual intentions and decisions of the flood victims for there may be different personal problems but the above-said measure is to be taken as a top priority of the state so the Party and the government will take full charge and care of the health and life of the flood victims who will come to Pyongyang in the sincerest manner and do their best to that end.\nNoting that the enemies persist in their foolish attempt to abuse the flood damage suffered by us as a chance for tarnishing the image of our state, he denounced the enemies on the strongest rhetorical terms, branding their fabrications as a smear campaign and a grave provocation against the DPRK and an insult to the flood-stricken people who are all safe and well.\nThere is no need to make educational materials exclusively as such a stark fact serves as good educational materials for giving a clear understanding of what a disgusting clan the enemies are, what an extremely anachronistic mode they have employed in their fabrications and politically-motivated false propaganda, what a black-hearted intention lurks behind it, and why we call them enemies and human scum, he stressed.\nNoting that we are facing a very important task to prevent natural disasters, which is more serious and urgent than the on-going large-scale rehabilitation, he set forth the tasks and ways for building nationwide disaster-prevention capabilities, including the issue of establishing a rapid and orderly weather forecast system for proactively controlling the factors vulnerable to natural disasters, and the issue of setting up an integrated water control system in all units in charge of managing power stations and dams, in particular.\nExpressing thanks to various foreign countries and international organizations for their offer of humanitarian support, he said what we regard as the best in all realms and processes of state affairs is the firm trust in the people and the way of tackling problems thoroughly based on self-reliance.   Our Party Central Committee and government will depend entirely on the patriotic enthusiasm and courage of our people and the potentialities of our country in the ongoing rehabilitation, too, he added.\nReferring to the fact that the DPRK has taken sure advantage in the ongoing rehabilitation by dint of nationwide concentration and all-people mobilization, he solemnly declared that our Party and government will readily brave any challenges to accomplish without fail the tasks of the times, the historic tasks which they decided and shouldered of their own accord for our great people and future, and surely live up to the people's trust with faithful service and good results.\nThe undying story, in whichKim Jong Unvisited the flood-stricken people again to console and encourage them and take important state measures repeatedly for stabilizing their living and successfully carrying out the rehabilitation, will be recorded in history as another legendary tale about his paternal love for the people to be etched in the great father's journey of devoted service, and as a significant event that adds vitality to the drive of the people all out in response to the Party's call, proving once again that the programme and policies of the WPK and the DPRK government are based on the people-first doctrine. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- The following is the full text of the respected ComradeKim Jong Un's important speech before flood victims:\nDear inhabitants from the flood-stricken area,\nHow do you do, everyone?\nI think you must be experiencing much inconvenience and difficulty in this evacuation area after leaving your houses owing to the unexpected natural disaster.\nSome days ago I saw your circumstances and had emergency measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the state on the flood-stricken spot, but I could hardly get to work at the thought about the flood victims.\nOf course, I have received reports several times a day that all the victims are leading a more or less stabilized life, but I could not be relieved from worry for a moment.\nI have come here again to acquaint myself with the situation in greater detail on the spot, reassign some tasks for the rehabilitation project and take additional measures of national importance, which would be helpful to you.\nSeveral days have passed since you faced an abnormal living environment in temporary shelters after experiencing a great unexpected disaster, and I have felt ill at ease as I have failed to help you greatly in spite of the willingness to do something somehow.\nThough the whole country has turned out to sincerely help you, for the present I cannot but feel anxious and impatient as I am unable to remove all the inconveniences you are experiencing in the damp tents and poorly-furnished public facilities.\nNevertheless, as I see all of you in good health, showing no sign of inconvenience, I feel much relieved and greatly encouraged.\nOur Party and government should have given you strength and energy, but they are gaining strength from your appearance.\nYou have always trusted and relied on our Party and government, and in these days of harsh trials, too, you place such an absolute and unconditional trust on them. I feel very grateful for and proud of it.\nAnd I realize more keenly what should I do more and how for these laudable people, who steadfastly follow our Party devoting their pure loyalty and a sense of obligation throughout their life.\nWhat I would like to mention first here is that the Central Committee of our Party and the government of our Republic will always share with you your pains caused by the disaster.\nThe people are the foundation and pillars of our Party and state and the starting point and focus of their all activities.\nGoing closer to the people to share their feelings the harder the times are is the mode of existence and activities inherent to our Party.\nThe place where the leadership of our state should find itself at a time when the people suffered disaster like this is the disaster-stricken area and rehabilitation project site.\nExtending once again profound consolation to you, I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to outline the immediate measures our Party and government will take to promote the living of the flood victims and repair the damage.\nAll work of the Party and the state are now concentrated on the rehabilitation campaign here.\nNot only here but also some areas in Jagang and Ryanggang provinces in the basin of the Amnok River suffered damage.\nIn order to finish the campaign in the shortest period possible on the highest level, the Party and the government have decided to make a readjustment of even some of the construction projects of national importance and commit colossal human and material resources to the campaign.\nFor us today, nothing is more important and urgent than to stabilize the living of the flood victims and take permanent safety measures to prevent any recurrence of flooding.\nAs a preliminary to the enforcement of effective measures for fully restoring the flood victims\u2019 living conditions as soon as possible and removing the aftermath of the natural calamity, a comprehensive and detailed investigation about the damage is ongoing, and the relevant sector is striving hard to draw up a scientific plan for the restoration project.\nA more than 130 000-strong construction workforce comprising service personnel of the People\u2019s Army and young people is being committed for the restoration work here in North Phyongan Province alone.\nAt the national level, the Central Committee on Measures for Repairing the Damage was organized and has commenced its work, to be followed by provincial on-site headquarters for the restoration work; and the transportation of necessary materials has already been switched over to an emergency system.\nOur objective in displaying such daring spirit, organizing work at lightning speed and seeking its unfailing implementation is to transform your dear island villages and the northwestern part of the country beyond recognition.\nComrades,\nThe whole country is all out for the restoration work, but given the extent of damage, it will take at least two or three months to stabilize the flood victims\u2019 living by building new houses and repairing the existing ones.\nWhat the Party and the government should give top priority to in this period is to take good care of their living as much as possible.\nRecently, I am holding consultations every day with leading officials of the relevant institutions over the necessary measures to be adopted to this end.\nIt is indispensable to set up a well-regulated system for the distribution of newspapers and other publications, supply a TV set to each family and install one in every public place, so that the afflicted residents can keep abreast of the Party\u2019s intentions, and to direct close attention to ensuring them a good meal.\nThe biggest bottleneck in the flood-stricken areas is the living and teaching for students and other children.\nCurrently, some leading officials within our government, for their lack of experience and qualifications, are making a point of the restoration work in total disregard of educating and caring for students and other children.\nNeedless to say, children will find it quite inconvenient to live in tents or others\u2019 houses until the completion of the restoration work, and, in particular, this will have a serious impact on their education.\nAlso, measures for medical care are not going beyond the supply of medicines, and there is not yet a specific and realistic plan for medical services.\nWith regard to this, I criticized the officials concerned at yesterday\u2019s consultative meeting with the relevant departments of the Party Central Committee.\nSo, we are going to put in place an emergency system, whereby during the restoration work the students and all other children of the afflicted families in North Phyongan, Jagang and Ryanggang provinces shall stay in Pyongyang and be provided with a safe and comfortable environment for care and education, entirely at state expense.\nNursing, edification and education of students and other children are the most important of all state affairs never to be abandoned even if the sky may fall in.\nSo, the state is going to take full responsibility for this work during the rehabilitation campaign period.\nAnd state-backed care benefits will be offered in Pyongyang to the elderly and sick persons, honoured disabled ex-soldiers and nursing mothers before new houses are built in the flood-stricken areas.\nAccording to a rough estimate,\u00a0among the families of flood victims preschoolers number 2 198, students 4 384, the elderly 4 524, the sick and the honoured disabled ex-soldiers 265, and nursing mothers 4 096.\nThen, the number of flood victims who will be brought to Pyongyang will total over 15 400.\nWith a view to giving such a state emergency assistance, the Party Central Committee will organize a command team and ensure that services for them are offered at the April 25 Hostel and the military parade training base in Pyongyang.\nIt will provide temporary learning spaces for students and other children and organize interim mobile educational teams, comprising teachers from primary and middle schools and preschool educational institutions in Pyongyang. They will give education without letup to the students and other children after their summer vacation is over.\nIt will also ensure that staple and subsidiary foods, daily necessities and medicines are fully supplied, and mobile service and medical teams are organized with competent members from the important service units and hospitals in Pyongyang so as to direct all efforts to ensuring the living conditions of flood victims according to the state\u2019s special measures.\nThere might be some mothers who are reluctant to be separated from their little children for several months, and there might be some persons who are unwilling to leave for some reasons, I think.\nAs there may be their personal reasons, I will leave it to their intentions and decisions.\nHowever, this was organized to do even one more thing helpful to the flood victims suffering in the unfamiliar areas and minimize their inconveniences, you may rest assured of me, I think.\nAs it is the top priority work of the state, the Party and the government will take full responsibility for caring with utmost sincerity the health and living of the flood victims coming to Pyongyang as their parents and children would do, and make special and devoted efforts lest all of them feel an iota of gloom.\nIt is another problem facing the families evacuated from the areas, which are undergoing rehabilitation, that they have no proper places to keep their family property even if they manage to get them out of water.\nThe flood victims do not show any signs of it, but they might feel great anxiety.\nSo for the convenience of the evacuated families during the construction of new houses, we should offer them places where they can keep their household belongings safely.\nThis will also be good for the families to be enjoying protection and care in Pyongyang.\nComrades,\nIt is necessary for us to impress on our mind once again that the current rehabilitation project is not simply an undertaking for our own but also a serious struggle against the enemy.\nAt present, the enemy, misusing the occasion when we have suffered damage, is continuing to make foolish attempts to tarnish the image of our state.\nIt is important to inform Party organizations and working people\u2019s organizations at all levels, various networks of education and the people of these facts and thus make them have a correct understanding of the ROK scum bordering on us.\nThe rubbish ROK\u2019s media are desperately slandering all the socialist benefits and measures taken by our Party and government for the flood victims and also the communist traits displayed throughout the society, abusing them as a means of achieving some sort of internal unity and a type of demonstration. They are also fabricating such false information, in their frantic manoeuvres to slander our government and system, that the missing persons in the afflicted areas exceed 1 000 in number and that its intelligence authorities found out that several helicopters had fallen on rescue mission.\nWorse still, they are spreading a baseless rumour that the V-day celebrations took place in Pyongyang on the 27th of last month when loss of life occurred in the flood-hit areas.\nBecause the rumour is in wide circulation in the ROK society that its government is always late in coping with all sorts of accidents that happened there and such is an everyday occurrence in the country, they seem to weave absurd sophistry that slanders and slights us in an attempt to coax their citizens and stir up world public sentiments.\nWhen I visited the helicopter unit that rescued you, I gave full account of the rescue operation, including the crash-landing by one helicopter during the operation, and expressed my gratitude that there had been no casualties in the turmoil.\nThe enemy even went so far as to say that I reacted personally to the report fabricated by their media because there were heavy casualties and I intended to cover it up.\nWhat is their dogged insistence on making you, safe and sound like this, missing or dead? It is an open and shut case.\nThis is a smear campaign and a grave provocation against our state as well as an insult to you.\nI have reason and feel it necessary to say this about the media of the dirty, rubbish country.\nThere is no need for us to make separate materials for education. It is because these clear facts are actual and educational materials good enough to clearly bring home to the people how filthy the enemy clan is, what ancient and old-fashioned way they resort to for fabrication and political smear campaign to tarnish the image of our state, what their ulterior motives are and why we call the enemy the enemy and scum.\nNo country in the world has such media which does nothing but to invent groundless and exaggerated lies.\nWhat we must clearly realize is that the enemy is what we see them now.\nReferring to these actual facts, the whole country should have a correct understanding of the enemy and cultivate a correct feeling against them.\nOur enemy is an unchangeable enemy.\nWe should make the current opportunity, which helps us to have a correct understanding of what our enemy is, an opportunity of having a correct stand towards the enemy.\nToday, present here are leading officials of Party organizations and government organs of North Phyongan Province, as well as officials of Uiju County.\nI would like to take this opportunity to dwell on the tasks of regional Party organizations and government organs for stabilizing the living of flood victims and repairing the damage in the disaster-stricken areas.\nThe masters of relevant areas should play their proper role in the effort to stabilize the living of the flood victims at the earliest possible date.\nAs you have witnessed, many flood victims in different areas including North Phyongan and Jagang provinces are living outdoors in the violent heat and sultry weather.\nOf course, we built houses for the people without fail in the past, however many of them were destroyed, and now the flood victims in the afflicted areas are living optimistically, placing their trust in our Party.\nEven so, local Party organizations and government organs should never make light of the fact that there are people who have been left homeless and are living in tents.\nThey should ensure that food, non-staple foodstuffs and fuel indispensable for their living are supplied regularly without running short of them, and take strong measures to supply them with daily necessities.\nProvinces, cities and counties should promote the flood victims\u2019 living by providing them in a responsible manner with the food and other materials in need with those in reserve and promptly supplying them with relief materials of the state.\nThey should supply the flood victims with all daily necessities, ranging from bedding, sanitation goods to such small articles as scissors, needles and threads.\nThey should direct close attention to the supply of drinking water.\nWater is one of the basic essentials for people\u2019s living, and drinking water is badly needed in the flood-hit areas where there are scarce sources of it owing to pollution caused by flood damage.\nParty organizations and power organs in the relevant areas should do away with a temporary attitude, and take effective steps for supplying enough drinking water to places where the flood victims live.\nPublic health and epidemic prevention are the most vulnerable sectors in the afflicted areas.\nWherever the flood victims have been evacuated, it is necessary, by taking their number into account, to properly install bathrooms, public toilets, garbage dumps and drain pipes in conformity with hygienic standards and effectively maintain them, so as to eliminate the sources of outbreak of epidemic diseases.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should commit all medical resources available in the areas to taking good care of the victims\u2019 health in a responsible manner, supply them with Koryo and other medicines to the utmost, and conduct an epidemic prevention campaign in an intensive way.\nThey should be proactive in organizing and conducting the rehabilitation project to restore the production and living order in the flood-hit areas to the normal level.\nThey should strictly conduct a safety test of the afflicted dwelling houses and public buildings, and on the basis of this, promptly launch the rehabilitation project.\nA key factor in this regard is to check such details as whether the buildings, which were submerged, have not undergone structural changes and whether their foundations are firm enough, and thoroughgoing measures should be adopted for preventing second damage due to the collapse of those buildings.\nAnother important factor is to distinguish what should be newly built from what are in need of repair, introduce a scientific order of priority and plans for the restoration work, and give priority to the construction and repair of houses so that the flood victims can move into them as soon as possible.\nIn addition, the socio-economic life in the afflicted areas should be put back on a normal track at the earliest possible date by vigorously pushing forward the rehabilitation of the damaged public buildings and industrial facilities including schools, kindergartens, hospitals, factories and enterprises.\nThe designing and construction of dams in the afflicted areas should be done in a scientific way, based on a comprehensive and detailed survey of the local physiographical conditions and embankments. In particular, it is important in designing the dams to make an accurate estimate of the conditions at the time of the highest level of water, and, wherever necessary, to install flood-blocking structures.\nAs things stand at the moment, our regions are unilaterally vulnerable to the rising level of water flowing into the Amnok River. This time we should decisively remove this chronic vulnerability, thus totally eliminating the source of risk of flood wreaking havoc on Uiju County and the city of Sinuiju on the lower reaches of the river.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should adopt prompt measures for restoring the major elements of infrastructure in the afflicted areas, such as roads, railways, communications and power grids.\nEnsuring free traffic flow is a pressing task, since it is a prerequisite for the transport of manpower, equipment and materials to the rehabilitation sites and for the residents\u2019 free economic activities. So, it is urgent to open the roads and railways in cooperation with the People\u2019s Army units that have been seconded to the rehabilitation project. Efforts should also be focused on restoring communications and the power grids to meet the needs of the local residents and the rehabilitation project for communication and electricity at the earliest possible date.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should work in a responsible manner to recover damage that has been done to the agricultural sector.\nThis time not a few hectares of crop fields were inundated; they should not give up or feel disheartened, but make redoubled efforts to prevent the spread of damage.\nThey should learn a lesson from the fact that the key aspect of damage is the most of the crop fields being submerged. They should identify the weak spots in the dams, river embankments and waterways, and take thoroughgoing steps for repairing and reinforcing them immediately, while adopting scientific and technological measures for improving the growth of crops in the afflicted fields.\nBased on a detailed analysis of the pumping stations for drainage, they should double their capacity to keep farmland from being damaged by any possible flood, and provide a firm scientific and technical guarantee for their regular operation at full capacity.\nThey should focus on the political work aimed at instilling confidence in the junior officials of the farms and other farmers and mobilizing them, giving effective and responsible guidance over the work of repairing the damage done to the crops.\nThey should also give a strong impetus to restoring the arable land that has been buried or washed away.\nComrades,\nWe are currently facing a crucial task of disaster prevention, which is no less important and which is much more serious and urgent, than the huge rehabilitation project.\nRecently, the extent of damage caused by disastrous weather conditions is increasing worldwide year after year, and in actual fact, no part of our country is absolutely safe, i.e., insusceptible to flooding and typhoon.\nThis being the case, some officials neglect the disaster prevention work, arguing on their regional characteristics or browsing through meteorological observation records. Such is a very dangerous and unpardonable act which is tantamount to gambling with people\u2019s safety.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should stake their future development on the prevention of recurrence of damage by disastrous weather conditions, putting themselves on tenterhooks and making redoubled efforts to preclude any more disastrous consequences.\nFor the present, they should set up a prompt and well-knit weather forecasting system and establish the discipline, order and system whereby all the sectors and units in their respective regions respond effectively to any disastrous weather conditions. In this way, they can keep themselves from being affected by the expected heavy rain and typhoon.\nDamage caused by the recent flood highlighted how important it is in the prevention of disasters to ensure close contact and cooperation among various sectors and regions.\nIn case of emergency regions should maintain close contacts, promptly informing one another of what elements are at risk and actively regulating and adjusting their responses. In particular, when heavy rain or flooding is imminent, all the units responsible for maintaining power stations and reservoir dams should absolutely obey the directives from the central organ that is in charge of the unified system for water control.\nIt is important for the state to renew its water control system and create a specialized institution in order to establish an integrated water control system for enforcing, adjusting and implementing a uniform water control policy, which will tackle various tasks facing regions, ranging from the supply of drinking water to responses to flooding, drought and other disasters.\nThe lesson taught by the recent flood damage has proved that our pressing task is to make the organs in charge of maintaining the dams enhance their role, and to ensure their integrated coordination and put it on a scientific footing quickly.\nHowever, the existing disaster prevention organs are lame-duck entities substituting their assignment for collecting statistics.\nThis offers a glimpse of our officials\u2019 irresponsible work style, and if they stick to their stereotypical way of thinking and formalistic work methods, such disaster prevention organs, however many, will bring no benefit to the state.\nIt is advisable to study the issues of setting a flood warning period in the rainy season, ensuring unified and coordinated management of the sectoral and regional units in charge of water control, and putting a flood response system in place.\nAlong with this, an integrated flood forecast system should be established in a more scientific way.\nAs I have already stressed, any lax approach of failing to consider the worst conditions in construction will inevitably invite a terrible disaster.\nWe should build new, excellent houses where geographical safety against disaster is assured and perfect measures have been adopted for disaster prevention, so that they will last for the coming 50 to 100 years.\nTo this end, appropriate sites of construction should be fixed with their safety assessment as a major criterion; a proper plan for the distribution and layout of houses should be drawn up to provide every convenience for the residents and satisfy their demands; and the durability of houses should be ensured by increasing the amount of building materials needed for each house and encouraging the builders to enhance their sense of responsibility.\nWhat is no less important than to ensure high speed and good quality in the construction of houses is to sustain their modernity commensurate with the increased level of civilization of our people.\nThe designing and construction of houses should be done in a non-repetitive, diversified and unique style so they can meet the modern tastes and preserve the characteristic features of the given regions and villages.\nI want to specially emphasize that there should be no wrong practice of demolishing the existing houses and building new ones on their very sites in a perfunctory manner without an accurate calculation.\nIt is also important to give the residents regular education on how to cope with disasters.\nWe should work effectively to heighten their consciousness of coping with disasters; define, on the basis of a detailed survey and confirmation, the spots where the residents are to take shelter in case of disaster, and work out guidelines for their evacuation; and give a strong impetus to securing essential means of rescue operation to be used in various emergency circumstances.\nAll the regions should conduct a comprehensive review and investigation of their capabilities to prevent natural calamities, discover the weak points and adopt timely measures for reinforcing them. Also, in anticipation of the worst situation caused by torrential rain, flooding, typhoon and tidal waves, they should identify, eradicate and take precautions against dangerous spots, while paying due attention to ensuring effective afforestation and water conservation.\nComrades,\nThe enormous undertakings for the repairing of the damage, which constitutes a big step in the course of alleviating the people's pain, providing them with greater welfare and transforming the regions, make a particularly high demand on the officials of the field Party and government organs.\nAll the officials should display the spirit of sincerely and devotedly assisting the people in the afflicted areas and sharing joy and sorrow with them.\nThe respect for and devoted service to the people are the inherent duty and obligation of our officials, and when the people suffer hardship, they should especially be faithful to their own duty.\nIn particular, all the Party officials should go deep among the masses to strengthen ties with them and, in the course of this, get fused into a harmonious whole with them to inspire them to the rehabilitation campaign.\nLast, I would like to emphasize the need to prevent any deviation in the assistance to the people in the afflicted areas.\nAt present, all parts of the country, as well as the Party Central Committee, the Cabinet, ministries and national agencies, are rendering assistance to the flood victims.\nAssistance work must be conducted strictly on the principle of voluntariness, never in an organized or forced way.\nIn the past, when such natural disasters as flooding occurred, institutions, enterprises and working people\u2019s organizations revealed such practices as pointing out the variety and quantity of relief supplies to collect them, while cadres, prompted by the desire for personal fame, subjectively gave assignments for assistance work to gather materials and send them.\nWe must not get our people to send aid even by imposing burdens on them on the pretext that they do not make any complaints, regarding it as their natural duty to help the residents in the afflicted areas.\nSuch assistance is worse than not offering at all.\nIt is needed to intensify the grasp and guidance over the whole society in order to make sure that the assistance work for the people in the afflicted areas is done on the principle of voluntariness, strictly in accordance with the will of each person, so that this work becomes a process in which our society\u2019s great traits of sharing pain and sorrow and helping and leading one another forward are truthfully manifested in name and reality.\nAt the same time, it is necessary to grasp and register aid funds and materials in a unified way and distribute and supply them in a fair and rational way, so that they can be used effectively for the stabilization of the living of the flood victims and the damage recovery, while imposing strict control lest there should appear such undesirable practices as fame seeking, misappropriation and fraud.\nAt present, many countries and international organizations are expressing their willingness to provide us with humanitarian assistance.\nI extend thanks to them.\nBut what we put forward first in all domains and processes of the state affairs is the way of addressing problems by relying on the firm trust in the people and entirely on our own efforts.\nWhat the Party Central Committee and the government relies on in the current rehabilitation campaign is also the patriotic enthusiasm and valour of our people and the potentials of our state from A to Z.\nAs we have always done, we will value our confidence in our own strength more than anything else, solve all problems by enlisting the strength and wisdom of the people, and continue to steadily expand and increase our state\u2019s strength in that way to shape our future with our own strength and efforts in the future, too.\nAs all the national efforts are concentrated on the rehabilitation project and all the planned work is being smoothly pushed forward under the unified and powerful guidance of our government, we will, by and large, remain consistent in this principle.\nComrades,\nNationwide concentration and all-people mobilization\u2013these have given us a good chance of sure victory in the repairing of the disaster.\nIn order to accomplish the tasks of the times, the historic tasks on which we decided and which we have shouldered by ourselves for our beloved people and our future, the Party and the government will readily brave any challenges and live up to the people\u2019s trust with their faithful service and excellent results.\nWe will serve the people faithfully.\nAnd we will always be with you.\nDear inhabitants of Uiju County and the city of Sinuiju,\nDear inhabitants of the afflicted areas in Jagang and Ryanggang provinces,\nPlease inform us open-heartedly through the relevant Party organizations at any time if you feel any inconveniences or difficulties.\nPlease wait for the day when you will lead a new life in your living place which will be changed more splendidly.\nAnd I wish you good health free from illnesses.\nLet all of us pool our strength to successfully overcome the present crisis and get up.\nLong live our great people! -0-",

In the article, they defined the \"nuclear threat\" of the DPRK as a crucial \"security challenge\" in the Indo-Pacific region and advertised the U.S.-Japan-ROK tightened tripartite security cooperation targeting the DPRK as an important \"achievement\" in carrying out the foreign policy of their government.\nWhat is the purpose of the present U.S. administration to hold fast to its anti-DPRK policy on the verge of bankruptcy and advertise for its achievement even at a time when it is preparing for its retirement?\nThe DPRK's \"nuclear threat\", touted by the U.S., is an inevitable result of the latter's deep-rooted hostile policy toward the former that has lasted decades after decades and generation after generation.\nAs recognized by the international community, it is the U.S. that compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear weapons and it is none other than the successive U.S. administrations that have pushed the DPRK into bolstering up its nuclear war deterrence.\nThe outbursts that declared the \"end of regime\" in the DPRK were uttered by the top executive of the enemy state, and the \"declaration of a nuclear war\" and the \"nuclear operation guidelines\" targeting the DPRK, too, are all cooked up and implemented by the U.S.\nNo one can remain a passive onlooker to the robber who broke into one's house with a knife.\nThe DPRK's bolstering of its self-defence capabilities is the legitimate duty and right of a sovereign state to defend its national security, deter war and protect its people's life and future from the U.S. ever-increasing military threats and the regional security concern arousing therefrom.\nAs the U.S. persists in its moves to stifle the DPRK to the worst-ever level, the DPRK's absolute might will be rapidly bolstered up as a conditioned reflex and the level of security threat to the enemies will be directly proportional to it. This has now become a law.\nIn the final analysis, the U.S. persistent hostile policy toward the DPRK has not relieved the U.S. of \"security crisis\" and \"security uneasiness\", but rather produced a contrary result of increasing them.\nAnd as far as the biggest \"achievement\" of the present Biden clique is concerned, it only made the U.S., whose security was in an unsafe situation, a \"fixed target\" easy to aim during its office.\nThe strengthened tripartite security cooperation trumpeted by the U.S. has only made the peoples of Japan and the puppet ROK cannon fodder of nuclear war, rather than giving benefits to the two stooges.\nWhat the stooges got through the tripartite security cooperation are such strong protests of the peoples in their countries as \"security dilemma\", \"Is Japan really a sovereign state?\" and \"We oppose the U.S.-Japan-ROK war alliance disturbing peace!\" and a debt document called huge \"security dividend\" granted by their master.\nMoreover, the reckless expansion of the military bloc system based on the U.S. nuclear weapons that wrecks the balance of force in the region is bound to invite strong counteraction of independent states possessed of nuclear weapons.\nWhether the recent childish article of the U.S. rulers is aimed to inspire the stooges trembling before the super-strength of the armed forces of the DPRK or to calm down the accusations and condemnations to be flooded with after their retirement with \"calculated boasting of administrative achievements\", it doesn't hold any water and will only show the miserable appearance of the \"superpower\" on the downgrade.\nThe strength of the DPRK will continue to evolve and the supremacy of the power of its armed forces will know no limits.\nThe U.S. should always remember that it could live in peace and calm only when we live in peace and comfort. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 17 (KCNA) --Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, visited the April 25 Hostel on August 16 to learn about the preparations for the education of pupils from flood-hit areas.\nHe was accompanied by Jo Yong Won, Pak Jong Chon and Pak Thae Song, secretaries of the C.C., WPK, and Ju Chang Il and Han Kwang Sang, department directors of the C.C., WPK.\nAccording to the plan of the WPK Central Committee, some rooms in the April 25 Hostel have been turned into temporary classrooms for the said pupils, a mobile educational group comprising teachers of preschool educational institutions, primary and middle schools in Pyongyang was formed, and preparations for fresh-term teaching are being made in real earnest.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Unarrived at the April 25 Hostel and watched a demonstration lesson for a class of primary school pupils which was organized as part of preparations for new-term education of the pupils from flood-stricken areas.\nHe acquainted himself in detail with the provision of educational equipment and school fixtures and saw school things for the pupils.\nWatching with a broad smile on his face the pupils from various regions who are engrossed in the class, he said that he was proud that the Party Central Committee had made a prompt and correct decision to take measures for provisional education of children and pupils from the flood-hit areas and enforced it.

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- The Institute for American Studies of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea released the following press statement \"To bolster up self-defensive power for defending security environment of Korean peninsula and region is urgent requirement of times\" on August 18:\nThe U.S. and the ROK are going to stage Ulji Freedom Shield, large-scale provocative joint military exercises, from August 19 to 29.\nEven vassal countries affiliated to the \"UN Command\" will reportedly take part in the exercises involving 48 rounds of various outdoor mobile trainings such as live firing and landing drill on the sea and in the sky.\nThus, Ulji Freedom Shield fully betrays its dangerous colors as the biggest military training in the Asia-Pacific region and offensive multinational muscle-flexing involving even NATO member states.\nThe Institute for American Studies of the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK makes public this press statement to disclose the rash confrontational moves of the U.S. and the ROK escalating regional military confrontation and contradiction by kicking off such aggressive large-scale joint military exercises despite strong internal and external opposition.\n\nIs Ulji Freedom Shield \"defensive\" and \"transparent\"\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State recently termed the U.S.-ROK joint military exercises \"regular\" and \"defensive\", touting their \"transparency.\"\nThis is no more than rhetoric to cover up the dangerous and grave nature of their joint military drills and evade international community's criticism.\nIt is clearly recorded in the world history of wars that in preparation for a war, aggressor states followed a series of procedures, including adoption of war policy and military operation plan for its execution, advance deployment of forces, ceaseless simulated and actual war drills and war provocation.\nThe current U.S. administration has more openly pursued the policy of using nuclear weapons against the DPRK by specifying the \"end of regime\" of the latter as a goal in its \"nuclear posture review\" made public after its inauguration. It has put into practice its nuclear confrontation policy against the DPRK by releasing the \"Washington Declaration\", establishing a new U.S.-ROK \"nuclear consultative group\" and cooking up the \"guidelines on nuclear strategic plan and its operation.\"\nAccording to them, nuclear-powered submarines of the U.S. frequented the waters near the Korean peninsula in 2023, seven times as much as in 2022, and the number of flights of its fighters and bombers in the sky above it has quadrupled. Against this backdrop, nuclear carrier strike groups are being deployed there one after another along with massive introduction of U.S. latest war hardware such as F-35 stealth fighters and SM-6 ship-to-air interceptor missiles.\nF-16 fighters, which had been stationed in the Kunsan air base, were moved to the Osan air base near Seoul to form a \"super-powerful wing.\" And U.S. offensive  assets are concentrated on areas near the southern border of the DPRK.\nWorse still, the number of outdoor mobile training, staged as part of Ulji Freedom Shield, increased to 38 in 2023 and 48 in 2024, and has turned into provocative special warfare ones such special war training aimed at \"occupation of Pyongyang\" and \"beheading operation.\"\nNotably, the current exercises, including a drill simulating a nuclear confrontation with the DPRK, bring to light clearer the provocative nature of Ulji Freedom Shield as a prelude to a nuclear war.\n\"Transparency\" of the joint military drills touted by the U.S. is no more than trickery to deceive the international community.\nMost of the countries, which are to \"observe\" whether the U.S.-ROK joint military exercises are staged in conformity with the requirements of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are member states of the \"UN Command\" or NATO member states under the control of the U.S. So it is clearly evident that it is utterly impossible to expect any neutrality or impartiality from them.\nAll facts prove that Ulji Freedom Shield is neither \"defensive\" nor \"transparent\" but the most offensive and provocative war drills for aggression in the world.\n\nWhat impact have the U.S.-led joint military exercises had on international peace and stability\n\nIt is the typical method of the U.S. to pursue its unilateral and absolute security by infringing upon other countries' security and interests.\nIt is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. and its vassal countries have staged more than 200 joint military drills in the world annually and they have become more threatening in their nature.\nAs for RIMPAC kicked off in 1971 against the former Soviet Union, the joint military maneuvers didn't disappear despite the end of the Soviet-U.S. Cold War but have developed into the world's biggest multinational maritime joint military drills under the pretext of \"defeating\" new \"virtual enemy.\"\nFrom late July to early August this year, RIMPAC was staged in the largest-scale ever, involving 40 warships, three submarines, 150-odd aircraft and 25 000 troops from 29 countries.\nInternational security experts unanimously commented that the forms and contents of RIMPAC clearly prove that they are aimed at laying siege to and deter China.\nU.S.-led joint military drills are being staged frequently also in the European region, distressed by the world's worst-ever security crisis brought by the Ukrainian incident, to spark off great concern of the international community.\nThe U.S.-led joint military exercises Steadfast Defender were staged in the largest scale ever since the end of the Cold War near the border of Russia from January to May this year with the involvement of more than 90 000 forces, at least 50 warships including aircraft carriers, 80-odd fighter jets, over 1 100 combat vehicles.\nThe exercises, aimed at restoring the ever-dampening atmosphere of supporting Ukraine among European countries and inducing them to increase military expenditure, fully show the hostile intention of the U.S. to militarily deter Russia and seize the military hegemony in the region.\nIt is the fact never to be concealed and denied that the U.S.-led joint military drills are the grave root cause of escalating military confrontation and causing sustained instability across the world.\n\nWhat is the best way to ensure peace and stability\n\nShortly ago, the U.S. secretaries of State and Defense and the assistant to the president for National Security of the White House, in an article they jointly contribute to the press, betrayed the sinister intention to seize military hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region by inveigling not only regional vassal countries including Japan and the ROK but also countries outside the region.\nThis shows that the U.S.-led joint military drills have nothing to do with \"preserving regional security\" touted by it and its allied forces but serve as a political and military means to take more countries on the confrontation chariot driven by it to realize its hegemony.\nActually, major NATO members are taking part in the U.S.-ROK joint military exercises recently under the signboard of member states of the \"UN Command\" and the military nexus between Japan, the ROK and NATO is getting further tightened.\nThe U.S., which included in its defense budgets the \"Pacific deterrence plan\" of drastically reinforcing its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region in recently years, has annually increased the allotment for carrying it out. This predicts that the U.S. and its vassal countries would more openly engage in military intervention in the Korean peninsula and its vicinity.\nThe prevailing situation requires the independent and sovereign states to constantly maintain the balance of power for preventing a war by stockpiling the greatest deterrence for guaranteeing their sovereignty, security and interests in every way in the current and future uncertain security environment.\nThe more frequently the U.S. and its vassal countries commit collective military provocations, the stronger the deterrence of justice for neutralizing the threat there from and ensuring regional and global peace and stability will become.\nWe will continue to make crucial efforts to build up strong defence capabilities for creditably defending our state sovereignty, security, interests and territorial integrity and change the security environment of the Korean peninsula and the region in our favour. -0-",

It has put into practice its nuclear confrontation policy against the DPRK by releasing the \"Washington Declaration\", establishing a new U.S.-ROK \"nuclear consultative group\" and cooking up the \"guidelines on nuclear strategic plan and its operation.\"\nAccording to them, nuclear-powered submarines of the U.S. frequented the waters near the Korean peninsula in 2023, seven times as much as in 2022, and the number of flights of its fighters and bombers in the sky above it has quadrupled. Against this backdrop, nuclear carrier strike groups are being deployed there one after another along with massive introduction of U.S. latest war hardware such as F-35 stealth fighters and SM-6 ship-to-air interceptor missiles.\nF-16 fighters, which had been stationed in the Kunsan air base, were moved to the Osan air base near Seoul to form a \"super-powerful wing.\" And U.S. offensive  assets are concentrated on areas near the southern border of the DPRK.\nWorse still, the number of outdoor mobile training, staged as part of Ulji Freedom Shield, increased to 38 in 2023 and 48 in 2024, and has turned into provocative special warfare ones such special war training aimed at \"occupation of Pyongyang\" and \"beheading operation.\"\nNotably, the current exercises, including a drill simulating a nuclear confrontation with the DPRK, bring to light clearer the provocative nature of Ulji Freedom Shield as a prelude to a nuclear war.\n\"Transparency\" of the joint military drills touted by the U.S. is no more than trickery to deceive the international community.\nMost of the countries, which are to \"observe\" whether the U.S.-ROK joint military exercises are staged in conformity with the requirements of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are member states of the \"UN Command\" or NATO member states under the control of the U.S. So it is clearly evident that it is utterly impossible to expect any neutrality or impartiality from them.\nAll facts prove that Ulji Freedom Shield is neither \"defensive\" nor \"transparent\" but the most offensive and provocative war drills for aggression in the world.\n\nWhat impact have the U.S.-led joint military exercises had on international peace and stability\n\nIt is the typical method of the U.S. to pursue its unilateral and absolute security by infringing upon other countries' security and interests.\nIt is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. and its vassal countries have staged more than 200 joint military drills in the world annually and they have become more threatening in their nature.\nAs for RIMPAC kicked off in 1971 against the former Soviet Union, the joint military maneuvers didn't disappear despite the end of the Soviet-U.S. Cold War but have developed into the world's biggest multinational maritime joint military drills under the pretext of \"defeating\" new \"virtual enemy.\"\nFrom late July to early August this year, RIMPAC was staged in the largest-scale ever, involving 40 warships, three submarines, 150-odd aircraft and 25 000 troops from 29 countries.\nInternational security experts unanimously commented that the forms and contents of RIMPAC clearly prove that they are aimed at laying siege to and deter China.\nU.S.-led joint military drills are being staged frequently also in the European region, distressed by the world's worst-ever security crisis brought by the Ukrainian incident, to spark off great concern of the international community.\nThe U.S.-led joint military exercises Steadfast Defender were staged in the largest scale ever since the end of the Cold War near the border of Russia from January to May this year with the involvement of more than 90 000 forces, at least 50 warships including aircraft carriers, 80-odd fighter jets, over 1 100 combat vehicles.\nThe exercises, aimed at restoring the ever-dampening atmosphere of supporting Ukraine among European countries and inducing them to increase military expenditure, fully show the hostile intention of the U.S. to militarily deter Russia and seize the military hegemony in the region.\nIt is the fact never to be concealed and denied that the U.S.-led joint military drills are the grave root cause of escalating military confrontation and causing sustained instability across the world.\n\nWhat is the best way to ensure peace and stability\n\nShortly ago, the U.S. secretaries of State and Defense and the assistant to the president for National Security of the White House, in an article they jointly contribute to the press, betrayed the sinister intention to seize military hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region by inveigling not only regional vassal countries including Japan and the ROK but also countries outside the region.\nThis shows that the U.S.-led joint military drills have nothing to do with \"preserving regional security\" touted by it and its allied forces but serve as a political and military means to take more countries on the confrontation chariot driven by it to realize its hegemony.\nActually, major NATO members are taking part in the U.S.-ROK joint military exercises recently under the signboard of member states of the \"UN Command\" and the military nexus between Japan, the ROK and NATO is getting further tightened.\nThe U.S., which included in its defense budgets the \"Pacific deterrence plan\" of drastically reinforcing its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region in recently years, has annually increased the allotment for carrying it out. This predicts that the U.S. and its vassal countries would more openly engage in military intervention in the Korean peninsula and its vicinity.\nThe prevailing situation requires the independent and sovereign states to constantly maintain the balance of power for preventing a war by stockpiling the greatest deterrence for guaranteeing their sovereignty, security and interests in every way in the current and future uncertain security environment.\nThe more frequently the U.S. and its vassal countries commit collective military provocations, the stronger the deterrence of justice for neutralizing the threat there from and ensuring regional and global peace and stability will become.\nWe will continue to make crucial efforts to build up strong defence capabilities for creditably defending our state sovereignty, security, interests and territorial integrity and change the security environment of the Korean peninsula and the region in our favour. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea released the following press statement titled \"U.S. and its following forces will be made to pay dear price for their irresponsible act\" on August 18:\nShortly ago, Ukraine committed an extremely grave terrorist crime of killing tens of peaceable inhabitants and injuring hundreds through an armed invasion of the inviolable territory of Russia.\nThe reckless military provocations of the Zelenskiy puppet authorities\u00a0are nothing but their last-ditch efforts to put under control the daily-worsening war situation at any cost and continuously get military support from the U.S. and the Western masters to prolong their remaining days and disturb the public mindset by creating the unrest in the Russian society.\nThe DPRK Foreign Ministry bitterly denounces the armed attack on the territory of Russia being launched by the Zelenskiy puppet authorities\u00a0under the manipulation and support of the U.S. and the West as an unpardonable act of aggression and terrorism seriously encroaching upon the territorial integrity and security of a sovereign state and mercilessly killing peaceable civilians.\nThe reckless and intemperate military moves of the Zelenskiy puppet clique are enough to invite strong retaliation of Russia, and the stooges running amuck with the backing of their master should be completely eliminated militarily and physically.\nThe U.S. and its followers are held wholly responsible for the recent incident which can drive the whole of Europe into a new all-out war.\nThe U.S., the very one of the crisis in Ukraine, is getting more hell-bent in supporting weapons, while describing the atrocities of the Ukrainian armed bandits who are killing innocent inhabitants and destroying peaceful villages in Russia as \"legitimate military actions pursuant to the right to self-defence\".\nThe U.S. and its followers are misleading the public opinion as if they have nothing to do with the recent incident but various heavy hardware including the U.S. and the Western tanks being discovered in the Kursk battle field every day clearly proves who is standing behind Ukraine.\nThe present situation is an inevitable outcome of the U.S. and the West's vicious anti-Russia confrontation policy and acts of indiscriminately driving the Zelenskiy puppet authorities into the proxy war with Russia by providing them with an astronomical amount of lethal hardware, doing serious harm to the sovereignty, security and interests of Russia. As a result, the global security environment is being pushed to the threshold of the third world war.\nThe time will prove what is the danger of the U.S. ignorant move to drive the Kiev authorities into a proxy war until the last Ukrainian is left, seized with a hallucinant dream to bring a strategic defeat to Russia at any cost and what consequences it will entail.\nThose who do irresponsible and fearless acts will be made to pay a dear price for their acts, and provocateurs will be subject to due retaliation.\nThe U.S. and its followers should seriously reconsider the catastrophic disaster to be entailed by the self-destructive military provocations perpetrated by the Zelenskiy puppet clique and be wholly responsible for it.\nWe do not doubt that the brave army and people of Russia will deal a merciless military blow to the armed invaders and attain their goal to the last in Kursk, the hero land that defeated the large army of the Hitler fascist clique more than 80 years ago and opened a turning phase of war.\nThe present Kursk battle will be a prelude to the total destruction of the Zelenskiy puppet clique and the strategic defeat of the U.S. and the West.\nThe DPRK will always stand together with the Russian Federation that has turned out valiantly in the struggle for international justice and invariably and strongly support the sacred war of the Russian army and people to defend the sovereignty, security and interests of the state. -0-",

This is not for demonstrating the proud ever-victorious path it has covered or highlighting its recognized absolute prestige but for ensuring its firm existence, victorious development and rosy future, the article says, and goes on:\nSteadfast is the determination of our Party to set store by the first page of its sacred history and give invariable and steady continuity to it as new pages of its exploits are added to its history.\nThe party-building cause of the working class is a long-term undertaking which continues generation after generation and the issue of preserving the party's fighting programme and character and maintaining and intensifying its inherent nature and climate can never come to a settlement naturally although the party has a long ruling history and excellent traditions. It is the historical lesson taught by socialist construction that if a ruling party behaves in an authoritarian way, sticking to its role as a weapon of class struggle and a weapon of revolution and construction only, it will lose its leadership function and can not maintain its existence.\nA revolutionary party should never forget its founding history but carry it forward  invariably in order to remain faithful to its ideal and mission, consolidate its political climate and purify its climate.\nTo guarantee the eternal prosperity of the WPK by  inheriting the idea and spirit of the Party founding purely is the core of the idea of our Party building.\nThe WPK will shine more brilliantly as the organizer and guide of all victories and an invincible revolutionary party of the Korean people as there are the precious ideological and spiritual baton handed down by the pioneer generation of the cause of party building and the officials and the members of the Party, who are determined to inherit it in a pure, thorough and perfect way. -0-",

They called on the workers, peasants and all other walks of life to get united to show their mettle to monstrous Yoon, saying that now is the time to fight for an all-out war against him who puts the country and population into pain.\nThe participants held a ceremony of declaring an all-out war against puppet Yoon and kindling the torch of struggle.\nThen there took place the 103rd candlelight rally demanding the impeachment of Yoon.\nCharging that Yoon Suk Yeol's policy toward Japan is to promote Japan's position to a security ally from a colonial criminal state and open up the second colonial era in which its \"SDF\" sets the foot of aggression on this land, speakers at the rally stressed that any slight compromise with the Yoon regime would be just a pro-Japanese act.\nThen representatives of the candlelight actions in different regions read out a resolution on the nationwide candlelight demonstrations in August.\nThe resolution said that the parliamentary impeachment of Yoon became a fait accompli with more than 1.43 million petitioners involved and the candlelight resistance has entered a stage for rounding off the impeachment by the overwhelming public mindset. All-people resistance will be aroused through a forthcoming 100-day campaign to impeach Yoon without fail this year, it added.\nThe participants in the rally proposed an all-people 100-day general movement for the impeachment of Yoon, declaring that they would launch a signature campaign urging the regional law-makers to bring an impeachment bill, and the regional all-people rally, declaration on situation, fund-raising action for impeachment and other events.\nThe law-makers' meeting in company with the candlelight action, too, stated that Yoon Suk Yeol should be impeached at once and the political camp should implement the orders of the population, contending that he is returning to the era of Park Chung Hee's dictatorship as shown through his recent appointment of high-ranking officials. The minister of Defense was appointed as the head of the state security office and the head of the presidential guard as minister of Defense. Through them, Yoon is seeking to declare a \"martial law\" and then turn this land into a sea of war flames, it pointed out.\nAt the end of the rally, its participants staged a demonstration toward the puppet presidential office, chanting such slogans as \"Impeach Yoon Suk Yeol, a Japanese spy at the government-general in Ryongsan!\"\nMeanwhile, through press conferences, statements and commentaries, organizations of various circles strongly demanded the impeachment of puppet Yoon seeking to ignite a war.\nMedia of the puppet ROK reported that nothing could break the will of the candlelight demonstrators demanding the impeachment of Yoon and that the only way for preventing a nuclear war crisis is to impeach Yoon and this is the will of those involved in the candlelight actions. -0-",

This is a reckless provocative act of deliberately increasing the security instability in the region.\nThe U.S. is now getting more active in its arms sale to Japan, ROK and other allies in the Asia-Pacific region, and this is a challenge to security in the region that cannot be overlooked.\nLast year, too, the U.S. concluded a \"security of supply arrangement\" with the ROK military aimed at prompt supply of military goods, after deciding to deliver such various kinds of ultra-modern lethal war equipment worth of astronomical amount of money as 25 F-35 stealth fighters, 36 SM-6 fleet-to-air interceptor missiles and 42 AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.\nIt also offered six latest P-8A Poseidon sea-patrol planes to the ROK in June this year and is going to hand over in December the first supplies of 12 new-type MH-60R sea operational helicopters to delivered to the latter.\nBesides, it has recently eased its military technology and arms export control on UK and Australia and got more undisguised in the sale of weapons to its allies in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan and Taiwan.\nThe security crises in different parts of the world clearly prove that the U.S. offer of lethal weapons is a key factor in escalating military confrontation and contradiction in the region and disturbing the military balance and thus increasing the danger of a new conflict.\nThe prevailing situation urgently calls for thoroughly ensuring the military balance in the region by increasing the defence capabilities in every way in direct proportion to security challenge and threats that may result from the U.S. arms sale.\nTo thoroughly reject and strongly counter the imbalance of strength imposed by the U.S. and its followers is a prerequisite for defending the sovereign interests of our country and ensuring the regional peace and stability.\nSince the U.S. is keen on the provision of war hardware and lethal equipment to its allies in the region, the DPRK's strategic deterrence will be further strengthened to protect the national security and interests and the regional peace.\nThe DPRK will steadily conduct the necessary military activities for self-defence to control the military imbalance and instability that may be caused by the military moves and delivery of lethal equipment of the hostile forces getting more reckless with passage of time. -0-",

And it has operated even a group aimed at using nukes against a sovereign state, contrary to the UN Charter and other universal international law principles.\nThe situation goes to prove that the U.S., which likes to talk about non-existent \"nuclear threat\" from others, is the most irresponsible actor and rogue state triggering a nuclear arms race and increasing the possibility of nuclear clashes worldwide.\nHad the U.S. neither made nor used nuclear weapons, the concept of \"nuclear threat\" would not have appeared on the earth at all.\nThe nuclear threat to the international community has come from the U.S. not only in the 20th century but also in the 21st century, and its origin and orientation will remain unchanged in the future, too.\nOther sovereign states' efforts for bolstering up their defence capabilities to cope with the ever-increasing nuclear threat from the U.S. can never be a pretext for its nuclear arms buildup for aggression and provocative coordination of nuclear posture.\nNo matter how desperately the U.S. may exaggerate the \"nuclear threat\" from other countries, the DPRK will push forward the building of nuclear force sufficient and reliable enough to firmly defend the sovereignty and security interests of the country on its fixed timetable, and this is the most essential and legitimate exercise of the right to self-defence to ensure the regional peace and security and protect itself.\nThe DPRK will as ever bolster up its strategic strength in every way to control and eliminate all sorts of security challenges that may result from the U.S. dangerous nuclear posture readjustment, and resolutely counter any type of nuclear threat. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 24 (KCNA) -- The Disarmament and Peace Institute of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Saturday released a white paper, as regards the 75th anniversary of effectuation of the North Atlantic Treaty, to disclose the atrocious criminal colors of NATO, which has forced wars and sacrifices on innocent sovereign states for over 70 years and still now lays a grave obstacle to the world peace and security environment.\nPointing out that NATO is a war alliance based on the extreme ambition for hegemony, the white paper said:\nIt is known to everyone that NATO is a military bloc established on the U.S. initiative allegedly to cope with the \"Soviet Union's threat\" and \"communist aggression\" after the Second World War.\nIt will be hard to explain why NATO, cooked up under the pretext of \"regional collective defense\" with a geographical concept of the North Atlantic Ocean artificially termed, is now stretching its tentacle of aggression to different parts of the world.\nThe 75-year history of NATO, stained with merciless massacre and war records, goes to prove that it is a criminal group of heinous hegemonic forces obsessed with the ambition for domination over the whole.\nIt is well evidenced by the \"strategic concepts\" raised by NATO after the end of the Cold War.\nThe dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty Organization on March 31, 1991, which had existed for 36 years, meant collapse of the East-West cold war structure. After all, NATO came to lose the justification for its existence to \"defend the free world from communist threat\".\nUnder such situation, NATO got hell-bent on laying a legal foundation to hold hegemony in the international military and political arena by expanding the mission and duty of the organization, which had been confined to the \"regional collective defence\", to \"ensuring world security\".\nThe bloody footprints of NATO's aggression, marked in East Europe, Asia and Africa in succession after the disappearance of the East-West confrontation structure in ideology with the end of the Cold War, were by no means attributable to their ideological difference.\nThe present Ukrainian crisis is the latest instance eloquently proving the unchangeable sinister intention of NATO to dominate the world and hold global supremacy.\nAfter the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, NATO made its commitment to the world never to seek the expansion of alliance targeting Russia\nBut it discarded its promise to the international community and has doubled its body by accepting 16 countries on seven occasions since 1999.\nDespite repeated concerns and warnings of Russia, NATO pushed ahead with its continuous advance toward the East while seriously violating security interests of the sovereign state and, moreover, tried to draw even Ukraine bordering Russia into the sphere of its influence. Such reckless moves for expanding its sphere are the main factor that brought the present security situation to Europe\nNow, NATO is inciting the hirelings of the Kiev authorities to attack the territory of Russia with arms offered by the U.S. and the West, out of its sinister plan to spread the flames of the Ukrainian battlefield to the Russian mainland at any cost. Recently, it is feigning ignorance of such dangerous military acts as an attack on nuclear power plants.\nMore than 900 days of the Ukrainian crisis, which has been going on for years accompanied by the unprecedented risk of a nuclear war outbreak, can be called a long-length drama of history that has clearly shown once again to the world people the sinister intention of NATO which does not hesitate to gamble any terror only for its geopolitical interests.\nNATO is the world's biggest war alliance in view of its scale and duration of existence or its anti-peace evil deeds recorded in history.\nThe white paper disclosed the fact that NATO is making desperate efforts to bring a new war cloud to the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn June 2022, NATO adopted a new \"strategic conception\" specifying the future strategic direction, with the Madrid summit in Spain as an occasion. In the \"conception\", it defined China as a \"systematic challenge\" and Russia as \"the most grave and direct threat\".\nIn the past, NATO tried to expand its jurisdiction to such world issues as WMD proliferation, terrorism, cyber attack and climate change through revision of the \"strategic conception\". But it had never formulated specific countries as strategic foes.\nConsidering that NATO's \"strategic conception\", published for about ten cyclic years, is a major document second in importance after its treaty as it is intended to regulate the organization's long-term action guidelines, the adoption of new \"strategic conception\" suggests that NATO has definitely turned its course to the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn particular, politicians of the U.S., little short of the chief of NATO, are now openly making an ill-bodying assertion that the treaty should interpreted on an extension basis or revised so that the application scope of the alliance's collective defense can be expanded to the U.S. territory in the Pacific including Hawaii.\nBesides, NATO is amplifying the \"theory of threat from Russia and China\" under the pretext of the Ukrainian situation and the situation of the Straits of Taiwan on different occasions, including the Vilnius Summit in 2023 and the Washington Summit in 2024. It is also trying to \"justify\" its advance into the Asia-Pacific region, claiming \"the Atlantic and the Pacific are inseparable in terms of security\".\nIt is the truth proved by history and reality that if NATO, which has been branded as a war machine by world people, enters any region, there is nothing good from A to Z.\nNATO, which has been stretching out its feet to the Asia-Pacific region, is now mobilizing various strategic assets for the U.S.-led joint military drills in the region, including the RIMPAC joint military maneuvers and Balikatan. This is why the war machinery called NATO is running all the year round in the Asia-Pacific region, which should have been the hub of global peace and prosperity.\nWhat should not be overlooked is that NATO has often slandered the DPRK's legitimate measures for bolstering up its capabilities for self-defence and intensified military infiltration into the Korean peninsula and its vicinity under that pretext.\nAll the circumstances go to prove that the plan for the \"expansion of NATO into the rest of the world\", worked out by the U.S. to realize its ambition for world domination after the termination of the Cold War, is being pushed forward with through the \"expansion of NATO into Asia-Pacific region\", and that the main course of the \"aggressor fleet\" called NATO has been turned towards the Korean peninsula.\nIf NATO, the world's largest group sharing nukes, continues its \"crusade\" towards the hot spot with nuclear weapons states as the main targets, the whole world will move a step and a step nearer to the threshold of a nuclear war.\nNot content with driving the security environment of the whole of Europe to an extreme phase, NATO is running amuck to bring new dark clouds of war to the Asia-Pacific region. It is, indeed, the worst group of confrontation in history.\nThe white paper stressed that the DPRK will redouble its responsible efforts to ensure balance of forces in the region, deter the outbreak of a new war and contribute to global peace and security in coping with the present military and political environment that is getting serious in its vicinity and the prospective security challenge. -0-",

So they persuaded or forced many Koreans to use the ship, saying that it is the only ship to sail to Korea.\nAt that time, ships of more than 100 tons were not allowed to sail in the territorial waters of Japan under the order of the Allied Forces, but the sailing of Ukishima-maru of over 4 000 tons was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Navy.\nOn August 22, 1945, the ship left Ominato Port with a small amount of fuel, sailed to the south along the western coast of Japan, and suddenly turned the helm near the port of Maizuru.\nOn Aug. 24, 1945, the Japanese on board fled by boat just before the explosion.\nSoon, loud explosive sounds were heard several times and the ship was sunk, broken in two. And the Koreans were buried at sea.\nAfter the incident occurred, the Japanese reactionaries made desperate efforts to cover up the truth behind the explosion of Ukishima-maru, terming it a \"sinking accident caused by a mine\".\nBut the Japanese reactionaries' assertion was clearly proved to be a sheer lie by the testimonies of the survivors and all the corroborative facts.\nThe explosion was not a mere sinking accident but a massacre committed according to the Japanese imperialists' premeditated and intentional manipulation.\nThis incident tells us how persistent and barbarous Japan's policy of exterminating the Korean nation was. -0-",

After all, NATO came to lose the justification for its existence to \"defend the free world from communist threat\".\nUnder such situation, NATO got hell-bent on laying a legal foundation to hold hegemony in the international military and political arena by expanding the mission and duty of the organization, which had been confined to the \"regional collective defence\", to \"ensuring world security\".\nThe bloody footprints of NATO's aggression, marked in East Europe, Asia and Africa in succession after the disappearance of the East-West confrontation structure in ideology with the end of the Cold War, were by no means attributable to their ideological difference.\nThe present Ukrainian crisis is the latest instance eloquently proving the unchangeable sinister intention of NATO to dominate the world and hold global supremacy.\nAfter the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, NATO made its commitment to the world never to seek the expansion of alliance targeting Russia\nBut it discarded its promise to the international community and has doubled its body by accepting 16 countries on seven occasions since 1999.\nDespite repeated concerns and warnings of Russia, NATO pushed ahead with its continuous advance toward the East while seriously violating security interests of the sovereign state and, moreover, tried to draw even Ukraine bordering Russia into the sphere of its influence. Such reckless moves for expanding its sphere are the main factor that brought the present security situation to Europe\nNow, NATO is inciting the hirelings of the Kiev authorities to attack the territory of Russia with arms offered by the U.S. and the West, out of its sinister plan to spread the flames of the Ukrainian battlefield to the Russian mainland at any cost. Recently, it is feigning ignorance of such dangerous military acts as an attack on nuclear power plants.\nMore than 900 days of the Ukrainian crisis, which has been going on for years accompanied by the unprecedented risk of a nuclear war outbreak, can be called a long-length drama of history that has clearly shown once again to the world people the sinister intention of NATO which does not hesitate to gamble any terror only for its geopolitical interests.\nNATO is the world's biggest war alliance in view of its scale and duration of existence or its anti-peace evil deeds recorded in history.\nThe white paper disclosed the fact that NATO is making desperate efforts to bring a new war cloud to the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn June 2022, NATO adopted a new \"strategic conception\" specifying the future strategic direction, with the Madrid summit in Spain as an occasion. In the \"conception\", it defined China as a \"systematic challenge\" and Russia as \"the most grave and direct threat\".\nIn the past, NATO tried to expand its jurisdiction to such world issues as WMD proliferation, terrorism, cyber attack and climate change through revision of the \"strategic conception\". But it had never formulated specific countries as strategic foes.\nConsidering that NATO's \"strategic conception\", published for about ten cyclic years, is a major document second in importance after its treaty as it is intended to regulate the organization's long-term action guidelines, the adoption of new \"strategic conception\" suggests that NATO has definitely turned its course to the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn particular, politicians of the U.S., little short of the chief of NATO, are now openly making an ill-bodying assertion that the treaty should interpreted on an extension basis or revised so that the application scope of the alliance's collective defense can be expanded to the U.S. territory in the Pacific including Hawaii.\nBesides, NATO is amplifying the \"theory of threat from Russia and China\" under the pretext of the Ukrainian situation and the situation of the Straits of Taiwan on different occasions, including the Vilnius Summit in 2023 and the Washington Summit in 2024. It is also trying to \"justify\" its advance into the Asia-Pacific region, claiming \"the Atlantic and the Pacific are inseparable in terms of security\".\nIt is the truth proved by history and reality that if NATO, which has been branded as a war machine by world people, enters any region, there is nothing good from A to Z.\nNATO, which has been stretching out its feet to the Asia-Pacific region, is now mobilizing various strategic assets for the U.S.-led joint military drills in the region, including the RIMPAC joint military maneuvers and Balikatan.

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) --Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, gave field guidance at various regional-industry factories under construction on August 24 and 25.\nHe was accompanied by Jo Yong Won, Pak Jong Chon, Kim Jae Ryong, Pak Thae Song, O Su Yong, Ju Chang Il, Kim Chol Sam and Kim Hwa Song, leading officials of the Central Committee of the WPK.\nHe was greeted by commanding officers of the military units involved in the construction of industrial factories in the relevant regions.\nWatching the plans for layouts of industrial factories and greenery in the regions, he was briefed on the progress made in construction projects by the commanding officers. Then he inspected the construction sties.\nIt seems as if I pressed the detonator at a groundbreaking ceremony heralding the arrival of a new era of regional development a few days ago, but factories have already taken shape, he said, expressing great satisfaction over the fact that the overall construction project has been carried out at over 80 percent.\nExamining carefully whether the construction of factories was done as specified in the production line designs to ensure smooth operation of equipment and maximum labor productivity, their interior walls were insulated to retain heat and exterior tiling was done impeccably, he estimated the quality level of construction.\nSaying that builders should never neglect the improvement of quality in construction, a policy requirement, as they may done so, carried away by the single desire to finish the construction of factories earlier, he called for building the regional-industry factories, which the Party promised to the people and the People's Army pledged to present to them as gift, to be impeccable even in the distant future. To this end, it is necessary to make higher demands on the field commanding officers and construction control organs and further enhance their roles, he added.\nWatching the soldier-builders' skilled work for a while, he instructed the accompanying officials to provide them with better working and living conditions and further intensify the frontline-style agit-prop activities to give full play to their mental power.\nHe underlined the need for the provincial, city and county Party organizations and people's committees at different levels to conduct the preparatory work, such as establishment of raw material supply bases and training of skilled workers, in a responsible manner so as to keep the factories in full-capacity operation after the completion of their buildings so that the regional people would benefit from them.\nSetting forth a new policy of accelerating the implementation of the historic cause of regional rejuvenation by pushing ahead the building of public health facilities, sci-tech learning spaces and grain management stations, simultaneously with the on-going construction of regional-industry factories, in order to hasten the accomplishment of the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy for bringing about a remarkable improvement in the regional economy and people's living standard, he clarified the decision of the Party Central Committee to make crucial measures to carry it out.\nPointing out that the Party made a crucial decision in such a harsh period as now as it is indispensable to bringing earlier a new era of epochal development and comprehensive development to all regions at the same time, he said that it would be most reasonable to complete the sci-tech learning spaces and finish the framework construction of hospitals and grain management stations, occasioned by the deployment of People's Army units in the relevant regions for construction of their industrial factories, and take state-sponsored measures to inaugurate the hospitals and grain management stations later in yearly order.\nIt is arising as the most essential task to be fulfilled without fail to successfully build large-scale modern hospitals in cities and counties of the regions, where the modernization level of public health faculties are relatively lower than those of the capital city, so as to promote the health of the regional people, he said, giving detailed instructions that in order to carry out the huge task, it is necessary to take measures to give precedence to the construction of their buildings, in parallel with the regional-industry factories' on schedule, and furnish them with necessary equipment, according to future state plans.\nUnderlining the need to build sci-tech learning centers, he said our purpose of urbanizing the rural villages is to transform as early as possible the regional people on a working-class pattern and make them progressive and well-versed in science and technology, not merely to model the countryside on urban architectural beauty. As a practical way, it is necessary to set up \"sci-tech learning centers\" in every city and county and disseminate knowledge needed in various fields, he said, adding it is an important affair conforming to the Party policy to build a country developing with science and technology.\nGiving an instruction to commonly call various facilities for processing and storing grain \"grain management stations\", he said that they should be completely rebuilt under the direct control of the state, not merely in a passive attitude of repairing the existing facilities, in order to properly store and manage grain harvested with much effort without waste, and provide the people with well-processed grain, in particular.\nAs the construction of regional-industry factories is proceeding on a full scale across the country and the system of construction force, supply of materials and command have been established in relatively good order, it is the best choice in terms of time and profit to push ahead with the simultaneous construction of modern hospitals, sci-tech learning centers and grain management stations in every city and county on that occasion, he affirmed repeatedly, adding that when the regional development policy becomes a comprehensive one of covering public health, science and education, not confined to the construction of only light industry factories, it can make sincere and tangible contributions to the improvement of the material and cultural life of the regional people and drastically raise the efficiency of regional development.\nThere would be no remaining manpower as it would be too much to build all the new dwelling houses with the rural construction forces in cities and counties only, but if the vital undertakings are neglected, the efforts for regional development will end in vain, he stressed, adding our Party made a bold decision, reposing its trust in our army, the faithful defender, supporter and implementer of the Party policies, the pioneer of high civilization in the new era and the creator of people's happiness. He set forth detailed orientation for the army units mobilized for the construction of regional-industry factories to properly organize and allocate manpower and meticulously draw up the construction timetable to successfully carry out their new tasks.\nHe said that leading officials of relevant sectors would deeply study detailed plans and ways for implementing the bigger ten-year goal for regional development before discussing, examining, deciding and adopting them at a plenary meeting to be held in December, and successfully carry out them in yearly order.\nThe tasks are huge and the conditions are difficult, but if we work harder, we can surely realize our ideal, and it is the spirit peculiar to the Korean revolutionaries to assume heavy duties by themselves in hard times, he said, adding the regions and rural villages will get rid of their centuries-old backwardness literally and undergo complete transformation and the appearance of our state be changed beyond recognition 10 years later when the grandiose goals will be attained. Appealing for finding the worth of doing revolution and tiding over the current ordeals, picturing that day, he expressed his conviction that the grand projects, which will serve as a great stride in hastening the regional rejuvenation and transformation, will come to fruition without fail.\nHis field guidance at the construction sites of regional-industry factories will be etched in history as an important occasion, in which an important guideline and militant banner for enriching the Party's Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy and developing it onto a new high stage was brought about, and as another political event of epochal significance in the leadership activities of the WPK remaining boundlessly faithful to the original duty it assumed at the time of its foundation to reflect the people's desire and demands in its policies and fulfill them. -0-",

But everywhere was full of good deeds and affection.\nThe whole country was turned into a large harmonious family and the era of great miracles, the Chollima era, was ushered in on this land as all the people dedicated themselves, placing the collective above themselves and giving priority to the country's affairs before their families.\nIt is thanks to this slogan that our people could firmly defend the dignity of the country in the grim trials of the 1990s.\nIn the new century, the DPRK people formed a large harmonious family with affection of kindred and obligation, more closely united in the face of the pain and trials, and achieved victory, through communist virtues and traits, in struggles with the severe natural disasters and the anti-epidemic crisis that can be called the one unprecedented in the history of the country.\nWhen any region of the country is stricken by a severe natural calamity, officials would find themselves among its inhabitants suffering inconvenience in life and show paternal affection for them, and the capital city renders sincere assistance to the disaster-hit areas. Such good deeds can be done only in our country.\nThe might and vitality of the communist slogan, which has been maintained through centuries, are being further displayed in the ongoing general advance towards the comprehensive development of socialist construction. -0-",

He said that practical measures will be taken to decisively increase the proportion of mechanization in regional construction.\nStressing the need to further encourage and expand the habit of evaluating the projects in strict conformity with the quality indices among the army units involved in the construction, construction control organs and other relevant sectors, he clarified the guidelines for thoroughly ensuring the quality of projects in keeping with the requirements of design and construction.\nHe expressed his view on the comprehensive principles to be maintained in designing industrial facilities, saying that the design sector should be developed faster than other sectors at a time when the scope of construction is steadily widened and the overall struggle for regional construction is being intensified in full swing.\nAfter looking round the construction sites, he had a talk with the leading officials accompanying him.\nSaying that success in implementing the Party's policies entirely depends on the leading officials, he pointed out a series of deviations that should be overcome without fail in the working method and style of the leading officials who should become an engine at every worksite of the revolution for comprehensive national rejuvenation.\nAnalyzing the practices revealed among officials who fail to give substantial and practical guidance from lack of detailed study into the present Party policies and the understanding of the Juche-based idea of architectural aesthetics and the importance and characteristics of the relevant construction projects and who are still not away from the sightseeing-style and stylish-manner guidance method of chanting groundless slogans which are not suited to the mind and age of the masses, he stressed that when they are well versed in the Party's policies and establish the initiative and active attitude and viewpoint in their implementation, even one field guidance can be a realistic and necessary one, a political guidance to the subordinates.\nHe also referred to the aimless competition which has not been eradicated in the construction field.\nNoting that when a competition is organized in the construction field, it should be a sure propellant to the cultural efflorescence of socialism, and the competition with the main stress on speed hindering the qualitative development of creation and construction has nothing to do with the mass movement of the present era of making a revolution, he said that the army units which assume the historic mission of the regional development should actively organize and conduct various functional competitions to radically improve skills of their officers and soldiers and beneficial and significant mass movements including training skilled workers, improving quality and arranging environment.\nSaying that the WPK has entrusted the huge and sacred historic process of bringing about regional changes by dint of self-reliance on the People\u2019s Army, believing in its loyalty and fighting efficiency, he clarified all tasks for giving full play to the might of the KPA in the honorable gigantic construction campaign.\nHe said that it is important for the KPA to conduct in a positive and fresh way the ideological education instilling into the service personnel the consciousness that they are the creator of material wealth for the people and pioneer of a new era of civilization in order to become a perfect vanguard in all aspects. He called for always sharing joy and sorrow with the local people as befitting the army of the people, fully displaying the beautiful traits of unity between the army and the people and briskly conducting the mass movement to do even one more thing for them, thus further glorifying the image of the revolutionary army and enhancing its distinguished prestige.\nAll the servicepersons who are performing brilliant feats in the vanguard of struggle for implementing the intermediate- and long-term tasks set forth by the Party are the most precious revolutionary soldiers, he said, calling upon the leading officials of the Party and the government and commanding officers of the military to make every possible effort to provide soldier-builders with better working conditions and hygienic and cultured living conditions.\nThe commanding officers of the KPA at all levels and the leading officials of the Party and the government hardened their firm will to powerfully wage the drive for carrying out the Party's decision thoroughly and perfectly with the most faithful service to the people and good results, bearing deep in mind the instructions of the respected ComradeKim Jong Un. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, September 2 (KCNA) -- The noble sense of mission, far-reaching ideal and stubborn practical ability of the Workers' Party of Korea, which regards it as its main focus to originate everything in its revolutionary guidance to absolutely defending the people's rights and interests and steadily develop in depth the policy for their well-being, strongly promote the comprehensive prosperity and development of the DPRK, unfolding in succession the blueprints of transformation most desired and welcomed by the people.\nAt a time when the modern rural housing construction is going on in a massive way to remove the countryside's centuries-old backwardness on a nationwide scale and the ten-year revolution was launched in real earnest to rebuild the regional economy on a completely new and advanced basis, under the WPK's grand regional development strategy, the Party Central Committee made an another crucial decision and entered into the preparations for adopting an eventful policy decision on carrying out the historic task of successfully building advanced public health facilities, sci-tech dissemination centres and grain management facilities simultaneously in cities and counties across the country.\nGeneral SecretaryKim Jong Unon August 31 convened and guided a consultative meeting for regional development project as part of the preparations for adopting a new important decision to hasten the epochal development and comprehensive prosperity of regions as a Party policy.\nPresent at the meeting were Presidium members Kim Tok Hun and Jo Yong Won and relevant members of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee, chief secretaries of the provincial party committees, commanding officers of the services and corps of the Korean People's Army which dispatched their units to the regional construction in different areas, and officials in the field of design.\nDeeply analyzing the significance and importance of the construction of health facilities, sci-tech dissemination centers and grain management facilities in cities and counties that arise as a more essential requirement in accelerating the development of the Korean revolution and the historic cause of regional rejuvenation at present, the General Secretary said that to thoroughly implement the Party's regional development strategy is not merely a practical undertaking for building factories and structures but an important political work for giving full play to the advantages of our state system based on the people-first principle to implant the truth and invincibility of the socialist cause deep in the people and ensure the steady succession to the socialist cause.\nIn recent years the WPK set forth a policy on building light industry factories in local areas to develop cities and counties, regional bases, substantially, materially and in a planned way and has pushed ahead with its implementation in every way, but this alone is not enough to provide the regional people across the country with a sustained and improved material and cultural life, he said.\nThe newly-added three-point construction task is in full accord with the regional construction policy of the WPK and its policy of prioritizing science and technology and people-oriented policies and it is essential for implementing the programme of state construction to achieve the balanced and simultaneous development of the whole country and, accordingly, it is an urgent task to carry it into practice, he said. And he reaffirmed that now is the best time for the start of this important revolutionary work since KPA units have been deployed in every province, city and county and a national material supply and command system established in a well-regulated way to implement the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy.\nThe Party's policy for regional development in the new era should not be confined to the construction of light industry factories but should be a comprehensive policy dealing with public health, science and education, and only then, it can make a genuine contribution to the improvement of regional people's material and cultural life and radically improve the efficiency of regional development, he said, clarifying all the principles to be adhered to in building advanced city and county hospitals, scientific and technological dissemination bases and grain management facilities.\nHe said that it is his first cherished desire to build city and county hospitals which will greatly contribute to improving the regional health situation, relatively inferior, and promoting the life and security and health of local people, adding that it would be good to add the construction of modern health facilities to the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy and complete their construction in the set year without fail for the people in different local areas, though it is very difficult to do, and that this will be regarded as the first task the Korean revolution and the times entrust the Party and the government.\nScience and technology dissemination centers, too, should be completed in a big way wonderfully to provide the working people from all walks of life in local areas with enough conditions for contributing to the development of the state by dint of technology and knowledge and also comprehensive and integrated rice-processing facilities be built to further improve the people's diet, he stressed.\nHe said that it is important for the provincial, city and county Party committees and people's committees to find out their definite shares of work, including preparations for the operation of newly-to-be-built objects, and launch effective work for their realization, more deeply mindful that they are responsible for the implementation of the regional development policy.\nThe meeting, on the basis of in-depth study of the key issues guaranteeing the feasibility of the three-point construction essential for the regional development, discussed such detailed practical measures as the reinforcement of KPA units at all levels involved in the regional construction and the establishment of a central policy guidance system over the construction sector.\nNoting that these gigantic projects launched by the WPK are an important undertaking based on scientific calculation and it is the requirement of the Party Central Committee that they should be carried out on the highest level so that the local people can benefit from them even after 100 years,Kim Jong Unexpressed belief that the more our Party, government and army shoulder heavy burden, the faster the new era of regional transformation change will be brought and the further the welfare of people across the country will be promoted.\nSaying that great years are being witnessed when a grand cause of regional transformation, envisaged as an ideal for nearly 80 years, is realized during the ten-year revolution, he called upon all officials to conduct their work in a responsible manner with their strong will and firm confidence to surely bring about a new appearance in which the whole country has been changed and a radical turn has taken place in the life of the regional people as required by the Party's policy of regional development.\nHe said that the historic cause of regional development is a revolutionary undertaking to be proud of, though it needs much efforts and that when new edifices symbolic of the people's happiness and regional development have appeared in 20 cities and counties every year and the whole country is seething with the song of radical changes, we will feel more proud of the dynamic pace of today which we have taken with readiness for courageous struggle and fortitude.\nThe precious guidelines, which clearly stress our sacred and just cause of supporting the people as heaven and indicate the ways for comprehensively and rapidly developing the whole country as befitting the status and position of a powerful country while firmly maintaining the Korean-style view on development and mode of development, redoubled the noble sense of mission and spirit of exertion of all the participants in the meeting.\nThe new direction of struggle, which is of great significance in accelerating the historic cause of regional rejuvenation, is the responsible option and worthwhile revolutionary work of the WPK which regards it as its revolutionary climate and supreme desire to courageously shoulder all the burdens for realizing the people's cherished wishes and bringing about the future full of happiness.\nAll the participants raised their enthusiastic applause, extending the highest tribute toKim Jong Unwho is dynamically ushering in a new era of socialist civilization and prosperity while arousing all our servicepersons and civilians to the great struggle with his ardent spirit of serving the country and the people and sacred step of the most staunch and active exploration.\nThe consultative meeting, held under the guidance of the respected ComradeKim Jong Un, served as a political occasion of weighty significance in providing a practical guarantee for the expanded and deepened regional development policy of the WPK. The grand ideal and strong might of self-reliance of the WPK translating the people's dreams and wishes into brilliant reality are making a series of remarkable changes and eye-opening efflorescence in all aspects of socialist construction, looking forward to the rosy future. -0-",

And they have been frantically staging the joint landing drill Ssangyong from August 26.\nSsangyong drill with the involvement of division-level forces, 40-odd warships and various kinds of 80-odd military planes and armored vehicles is an extremely reckless and dangerous military racket presupposing an open invasion upon the sacred territory of the DPRK.\nMeanwhile, the ROK military gangsters early in August introduced tanks and other offensive military hardware in the area five kilometers away from the southern border of the DPRK and committed a grave provocation by staging a brigade-level field mobile drill.\nFor the past two months the U.S. and the ROK military gangsters have desperately staged all sorts of provocative war exercises targeting the DPRK in the ground, sea and air, including a special operation drill aimed at the infiltration into the rear of the DPRK and \"small-unit mobile live firing drill\" involving the U.S. First Armored Division and the First Armored Brigade of the puppet ROK Army.\nThe provocative anti-DPRK military drills being staged by the U.S. and the ROK under the eyes of the DPRK without a time gap from the outset of this year clearly show what the source of escalating tension is and where the dark clouds of security instability are coming from on the Korean peninsula.\nNo such area as the Korean peninsula can be found on earth, where the joint military exercises targeting a sovereign state under different codenames such as Freedom Shield, combined joint formation drill, joint airborne infiltration drill, Iron Mace are being staged in succession.\nIt is the well-known fact that the accumulation of such threatening actions on the Korean peninsula, the hottest spot in the state of armistice in the world, will only spark off tensions and drive the security environment in the region into an irreversibly catastrophic situation.\nThe U.S. and its followers are seriously threatening regional peace and stability while getting hell-bent on unilateral military provocations. Their rash acts make clearer the origin of the provocation in a striking contrast to the peace-loving desire of the independent and sovereign states in the region.\nAs long as there exist the U.S. and the ROK, confrontational entities and destroyers of peace, the provocative military drills will continue, exposing the Korean peninsula to constant instability.\nThe present situation proves once again that the ceaseless building of the defence capabilities and their offensive application by the DPRK are the only way to neutralize the danger of war drills pursued by the U.S. and the ROK and to control the instability in the region.\nThe more frequently the U.S. and the ROK stage joint military drills, the more the DPRK hardens its will to defend the security and territorial integrity of the state by dint of powerful self-defensive strength, and this will lead to the strong deterrence, which the hostile forces seeking aggression are afraid and hesitate.\nThe Korean People\u2019s Army will never tolerate the U.S. and ROK's military moves threatening the security environment on the Korean peninsula but firmly guarantee the security of the state and the peace in the region by dint of strength and action.\nThe hostile forces can never evade the heavy responsibility for escalating tension and will have to pay a dear price. -0-",

Its campus was filled with the great emotion and joy of all the teaching staff and cadets who would have the highest honor and privilege of meeting the respected ComradeKim Jong Un.\nWhenKim Jong Unarrived at the academy, they raised stormy cheers of \"Hurrah!\" as the highest respects of the artillerymen to the iron-willed brilliant commander, the symbol of the absolute might of the DPRK and the banner of all victories and glory.\nHe was greeted by Army Senior Colonel Yu Chang Son, headmaster of the academy, and Army Senior Colonel Choe Hun, director of its Political Department.\nAfter receiving a salute from the headmaster,Kim Jong Unpaid homage to the colors.\nAn educator and a cadet of the academy presented bouquets of fragrant flowers to him, reflecting the boundless reverence of all the artillery officers and men.\nResponding to the enthusiastic cheers,Kim Jong Unsent militant encouragement to all the teaching staff of the prestigious academy, which has creditably discharged its sacred mission as the basic cornerstone and driving force for bolstering up the artillery force reliably guaranteeing the continued war-victory history and the strongest military and technical edge of our revolutionary armed forces, and its cadets growing up to be commanding officers of the core arm.\nHe was accompanied by Pak Jong Chon, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK and secretary of the C.C., WPK, Kang Sun Nam, minister of National Defence of the DPRK, Ri Yong Gil, chief of the KPA General Staff, Jong Kyong Thaek, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, Kim Myong Sik, commander of the Navy, Ri Chang Ho, director of the General Reconnaissance Bureau, and leading officials in the military education field of the DPRK Ministry of National Defence.\nAccompanying him were also Jo Yong Won, Ri Il Hwan and Kim Jae Ryong, secretaries of the C.C., WPK.\nKim Jong Unreviewed a march-past of the academy cadets.\nHe looked round the room for education in the revolutionary history.\nHe stressed that the academy, which has developed into a major center for training artillery commanding officers of the KPA under the great care of the peerlessly great men, recording immortal military feats in its history, should thoroughly implement the Party's idea of prioritizing the artillery and its policy on military education in the future, too, in order to train the competent military personnel strong in  idea and faith with the absolute loyalty to the Party and the revolution and the spirit of devotedly serving the country and the people and with high military qualifications.\nGuided by leading officials, he went round the arms study room and watched drill lectures given at the ground-based artillery firing research room and the artillery tactical research room. Then he learned in detail about the updating of education at the combined information control room for education.\nIt is our Party's philosophy of artillery and the core of its idea of attaching importance to artillery to open the road of advance with artillery and defeat overwhelmingly the enemy with artillery and display fireworks for celebrating the war victory and thus the most important aspect in the front of military education, a fortress and the forefront for implementing the line of building a powerful army of our Party, is the education field specializing in artillery, he said.\nNoting that no matter how difficult the subjective and objective situation may be, the revolution in training for the thorough combat posture of the entire army and the revolution in military education for making the entire army a cadre army and modernizing the entire army are the two fronts for building a powerful army that should be pushed forward simultaneously and vigorously without missing any one, he said that the academy should duly stand in the vanguard of a new revolution in military education for guaranteeing the eternal development of the armed forces of the DPRK.\nNoting that our Party has put the military technical strength\u00a0on an absolutely high level\u00a0by directing the main efforts to bolstering up the artillery force of specially great strategic and tactical significance among all arms of service in the army with a keen insight into the trend of the development of modern military capabilities, he stressed that whether or not the very powerful ultra-modern military hardware can fully display their performance for actual war entirely depends on the level and role of the artillery commanders.\nHe appreciated that the academy has intensified lectures for judging the combat situation of a commanding officer and giving a decision on his ability to command at a simulated war through a group discussion, and called for steadily accelerating the work to modernize educational means and put education on an IT and scientific basis.\nHe called on all the teachers and researchers of the academy to turn out as one in the work for bringing a revolution in the artillery tactics and the military theory of artillery pieces, with a noble sense of duty that they are responsible for the future of the Juche-based artillery force, and thus improve the quality of education and thoroughly establish a revolutionary habit of studying and military discipline in the campus so that cadets can acquire deeper and richer military knowledge during their school days.\nHe stressed the need to improve and adjust the academic system and educational system of the academy in a practical and efficient way in conformity with the trend of the development of modern military education so that the cadets can learn the practical tactics to be applied to actual warfare without fail.\nHe said that all the artillery commanding officers from this academy should be a-match-for-a-hundred all-powerful artillerymen and artillery talents well versed in the Juche-based artillery tactics and ultra-modern military hardware with different striking capabilities and possessed of full combat command capability capable of rapidly, fully and overwhelmingly containing and wiping out the enemy in any situation of modern warfare.\nSaying that to improve the educational conditions and environment in conformity with the academy's important duty and position in bolstering up the armed forces of the DPRK is very essential for considerably raising the quality of military education, he expressed the will to wonderfully turn the academy into a model of the military educational institutions of the entire army and a world-class military school, and took an important measure for doing so.\nHe indicated the ways for further strengthening the military education institutions at all levels of the KPA in line with the developing trend of modern education and for improving the educational environment.\nThat dayKim Jong Unhad a significant photo session with the teaching staff and cadets of the academy.\nAll the teaching staff and cadets expressed boundless thanks to the iron-willed brilliant commander who, with his outstanding idea of building the revolutionary armed forces and far-sighted wisdom, indicated the bright path to be followed by the academy for bolstering up the artillery force and repeatedly showed deep loving care and trust for them.\nKim Jong Unexpressed belief that the prestigious artillery academy would as ever live up to the great expectations of the Party, revolution, country and people with the proud military educational successes in training the core backbones of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK most wonderfully and perfectly.\nThunderous shouts of \"Kim Jong Un\" and \"Death-defying Defence\", raised at the campus sending offKim Jong Un, shook the sky and land.\nThe inspection of the artillery academy byKim Jong Unwith the steadfast will for building a powerful army to firmly consolidate the tremendous military muscle and thus reliably defend the sovereignty and interests of the DPRK, an independent power, and the security and well-being of its people for all ages, will remain long in the history of the country as a special occasion in ushering in a new heyday of strengthening the Juche-based artillery force and developing the military education. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, September 8 (KCNA) -- The chief of the Foreign News Section of the Department of Press and Information of the DPRK Foreign Ministry on Sunday issued a press statement titled \"We will continue to take practical measures to cope with the long-term nuclear confrontation with the U.S.\", which said:\nRecently the U.S. and the ROK held an \"Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group\" meeting and a \"Nuclear Consultative Group simulation drill\", revealing their intention to further strengthen the military conspiracy and nexus against the DPRK.\nThey conducted a confrontation conspiracy based on the nuclear war scenario and a \"simulation drill\" as its practical step, terming the DPRK's legitimate and reasonable measure for bolstering up its self-defence capabilities a \"threat\". This fact clearly shows the danger of the U.S. \"extended deterrence strategy\" to the global peace and security.\nThe DPRK Foreign Ministry expresses serious concern over and bitterly denounces and rejects the reckless moves of the hostile forces which are disturbing the regional strategic stability and increasing the possibility of nuclear clash by openly attempting to make a nuclear attack on a sovereign state.\nThe essential source of ever-worsening security environment in the Korean peninsula and the region at present is just the U.S. which is visualizing the nuclear threat to other sovereign countries while strengthening the military nexus with its vassal forces and cooking up the nuclear confrontation programmes one after another.\nThis year alone, the U.S. revised its \"nuclear weapons employment planning guidance\" for the purpose of pursuing the unchallenged nuclear edge over other sovereign states. And it, together with the ROK, cooked up the \"nuclear operations guidelines\" and formulated that nuclear weapons are included in the \"offer of extended deterrence\" to Japan.\nThe U.S. has also staged nuclear war drills in succession, including Iron Mace and Ulji Freedom Shield, to practically verify the plan for using nukes, while never disguising the fact that the DPRK is the target of its application.\nIt is a mockery of the DPRK and trickery against the international community that the U.S., which is constantly working out and updating war manuals focused on preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK, talks about \"denuclearization\" and \"dialogue\".\nThe present situation, in which the U.S. is persistently resorting to the attempt for using nukes against a sovereign state under the pretext of \"deterrence\", underscores the need for the DPRK to possess more strategic and fatal nuclear deterrent capable of thoroughly defending its sovereignty and security interests and rapidly raising the capability of control over the regional security situation.\nThe U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail will be thoroughly deterred by the DPRK's more perfect and developed nuclear forces for self-defence.\nThe DPRK will strictly control and manage the security situation of the Korean peninsula, which is getting ever more intense due to the U.S. and its followers' nuclear war hysteria, and continue to take practical measures to cope with the long-term nuclear confrontation with the U.S. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, September 10 (KCNA) --Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), made an important speech \"Let Us Further Strive for the Prosperity of Our Great State\" on September 9, the 76th founding anniversary of the DPRK.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Unin his speech extended warm greetings to the cadres of the Party and government, who are making ceaseless efforts to repay the trust of the great people with dedication to the heavy duties entrusted by them, and to all the people and service personnel, who are proudly celebrating the national day with precious pride  of devoting their pure and sincere patriotic loyalty and indomitable efforts to the dynamic creation struggle for prosperity, on the occasion of the founding anniversary of the DPRK.\nHe also extended his warm greetings to all overseas Koreans, including the patriotic compatriots of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  who invariably take the road of patriotism with warm love for their socialist homeland, and expressed his thanks to the peoples and friends of all friendly countries who recognize and support the sovereignty and just cause of the DPRK.\nAnd he paid high tribute to the revolutionary forerunners, patriotic martyrs and persons of merits of the preceding generations, who devoted their precious lives and feats to the foundation and development of the DPRK and the victorious advance of the socialist cause and created excellent traditions and examples to be followed by posterity.\nHe said as follows:\nWhenever we see with pride our national flags fluttering everywhere on this land invariably and more brilliantly and greet our national day every year, we naturally realize keenly that no country in the world is as great, wonderful and glorious as our Republic.\nWhen the DPRK was beating back the aggression of the imperialist allied forces which were incomparably superior in number, to say nothing of the time when our people were building a genuine people\u2019s country free from the vicious colonial rule, miracles unheard-of in other parts of the world were performed in the DPRK, and the historic course of Chollima Korea, which had made leaps forward to build a socialist nation on the ruins, and of Juche Korea was always full of miracles, too.\nWe take greater pride in the fact that such honorable course followed by our state was not confined to the past history of the preceding generations.\nToday's reality is also an extension of those miracles.\nWe are evidently making steady advance.\nDuring the period when one generation was replaced completely by another, our Party and people have defended and developed the socialist cause without any slightest vacillation or deviation despite countless severe challenges and trials - this is the most faithful and perfect continuity of the cause of Kimilsungism and a great political victory and historic miracle that has proved in practice the truth, eternal viability and vitality  of the great Juche idea and its entity - socialism of our style.\nThis clearly showed the whole world the truth of Juche and the immutable truth of invincibility that socialism, in which the people became its masters and remain faithful to their responsibility and role as masters, neither get ruined nor vacillate but  emerge victorious and develop forever, despite the vicious moves of the imperialist reactionary forces and the shifts in generation within the revolutionary ranks.\nThis year, too, our Party and government have organized and launched a gigantic undertaking which serves as a watershed in the course of the current advance for making epoch-making development of our cause of socialism.\nAs you all know, under the situation in which the tasks of the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan, decided and assigned by the Eighth Party Congress, are being carried out, we have added to the domain of our struggle and assumed such new intermediate- and long-range task as regional development. This is an expression of our firm trust and confidence in our strength, our Party Central Committee's revolutionary viewpoint and attitude to fulfill the responsibility and duty it has assumed for the times and history and, at the same time, a manifestation of its steadfast spirit of serving the people.\nWe are full of confidence to successfully brave such challenging trials and historical stages in the course of the advancing revolutionary cause.\nThis revolutionary decision we made recently is an important strategic decision to give full play to the advantages of socialism in actuality through the promotion of the well-being of the people throughout the country, thus further consolidating the foundations of our system and accelerating the overall state development.\nAs the country's economy still is not in conditions smooth enough to exert any reserve power, to provide cities and counties across the country with the basic material and technical foundations strong enough for their diversified and independent development in the next ten years would have been unthinkable in the past.\nBut in order to live up to the great expectations and trust of the people, the Party and the government worked out scientific strategies and realistic implementation plans, believing in the unconditional and absolute loyalty of our army and its strong fighting efficiency, and the entities of major regional-industry factories in 20 cities and counties are becoming clear as expected.\nNot content with this, the Party and the Government initiated an additional plan and are making preparations for putting it into thoroughgoing practice in order to get rid of the backwardness of regions as quickly as possible.\nI have already stressed to regard the regional development as the top-priority revolutionary task of the Party and the government, viewing it as a serious political issue.\nAs it is the work impossible to carry out for over 70 years and nearly 80 years, some would surely take sceptical attitude and stand towards the regional development plan.\nBut availing myself of this opportunity, I reaffirm on behalf of the Party and government.\nIs there a guarantee of success in implementing our regional development policy? Is it possible? It is possible.\nAfter ten years we will answer this question with real changes.\nIt is our successes that we steadily push forward with the implementation of the goals for  readjustment and reinforcement to be attained this year, while keeping the overall growth trend of the national economy and fulfilling without fail monthly and quarterly production plans in various sectors of the national economy, including key industries, despite manifold difficulties and obstacles.\nThis year we have provided conditions for making further improved and changed results in light industry, urban management and other sectors directly linked with the stabilization of the people\u2019s livelihood. The overall crops have so far been well and it is possible to expect fair good harvests.\nWe can appreciate that a series of progress have been made in reinforcing the national functions and capabilities for coping with any crisis brought by natural disasters.\nSevere floods hit some areas of North Phyongan Province along the lower River Amnok and of Jagang and Ryanggang provinces in late July, which hindered the state work and required the mobilization of huge forces for rehabilitation, but the Party and the government take it as an opportunity for making a new detailed survey of the shortcomings and discontinuities in coping with natural disasters and take prospective and irreversible measures for preventing them in the future. It can also be said as important progress.\nDespite this, we have achieved great epochal results by vigorously promoting the radical development of the defence capabilities to secure a reliable environment for security of the country and create conditions favourable to socialist construction.\nThis year, especially in some recent months, we secured wonderful military strength by making important achievements in national defence studies and production.\nWhen we comprehensively assess the present situation of all these state affairs, we can  analyze that almost all the major extra political tasks set forth by the Party Central Committee in planning and arranging this year's work are progressing successfully, correctly and satisfactorily.\nUrgent efforts should be made to further enrich and boost the successes achieved this year by making the most effective use of the remaining months, he said, and continued:\nThe most important thing for doing so is to further raise and expand the boundless patriotism and loyalty of all the Party members, working people and service personnel of the People's Army and lead them to successful fruition.\nThis is just the important and essential revolutionary duty facing the leading officials of our Party and Government.\nWe should complete the economic work for this year in a responsible manner to make fresh progress in the efforts for the comprehensive national rejuvenation and further improve the material and cultural life of the people.\nSo far, almost all the sectors of the national economy which are in charge of the 12 major goals have carried out their quotas without fail. The present fighting atmosphere and spirits are very good.\nIn order to maintain this trend in a sustainable way, it is necessary for all the sectors and units of the national economy to actively apply skilful operations and innovative methods of giving full play to the working people's enthusiasm for production and creativity and improving their technical skill levels.\nAnd by maintaining and repairing the existing equipment regularly, all the production sectors should prevent equipment accidents, raise the rate of operation to the maximum and ensure the quantitative and qualitative level of the products by constantly updating the production processes and equipment.\nHe referred to the tasks for fully ensuring stable production activities of major sectors of the national economy.\nTo further increase the national productivity by unconditionally finishing by the appointed time the plans of the key industries for adjustment and reinforcement to be fulfilled this year, the Cabinet and the state economic guidance organs should learn about the implementation of all the state measures and take a decisive measure at an early date by finding out other lacking problems and elements.\nHe went on:\nSince the development of the state and social life as well as the economy is expressed as entities of structures, the construction sector must carry out this year\u2019s plan without fail with the main emphasis on ensuring the quality thoroughly.\nWe should  thoroughly ensure the quality of the buildings directly related to the actual life of the people, including the 10 000 flats of the third stage in the Hwasong area and rural houses and, at the same time, raise the level of architectural design to the world level and make a remarkable change in the work for standardizing and modernizing construction equipment and tools.\nThe new hostels in Samjiyon City should be turned into hotels and more places developed as tourist resorts to make Samjiyon a world-class mountain tourist resort, he said, calling for steadily pushing forward with the projects for perfectly building the Wonsan Kalma coastal tourist area so as to run it from the next year.\nHe underscored the need to direct efforts to building a firm guarantee for actively enhancing the control and command of the economy as a whole by decisively updating the economic means and methods for directing and managing the national economy in keeping with the development of the times and the requirements of the reality, and underlined the need for the state to attach importance to smooth and comfortable circulation of products, to give priority to creating favorable conditions and environment for production and management activities based on the relative independence of enterprises and to take effective measures for continuously raising the real income of the working people.\nSaying that to carry out the grain production plan is not just a matter confined to the agricultural sector, but a political work to guarantee the victorious advance of socialism, he indicated the clear ways for successfully finishing this year's farming and making good preparations for next year's farming.\nHe analyzed and appreciated the work for recovering from flood damage to date and said:\nEven though the period is short and there are so many reconstruction projects, the quality of structures should never be reduced.\nNow that enough reconstruction forces have been mobilized and the enthusiasm of the soldier-builders and shock brigade members is great, whether the projects are completed in time or not depends on how the building materials, equipment and vehicles are supplied.\nThe Cabinet, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Railways and other ministries and national agencies should provide that steel, cement, fuel, timber, glass and other building materials and equipment at the fixed date according to plan, and take decisive measures to solve the acute transport problems so as to smoothly promote the projects.\nWe must finish the recovery from flood damage in a qualitative way within the fixed period and thus ensure a normal and stable life of the people in the flood-hit areas and put the damaged sectors of the national economy on their track so as to successfully complete the struggle with nature.\nHe said that the prerequisite task the Party and the government should specially place importance on and push ahead with is the unconditional and perfect implementation of the regional development policy in the new era.\nHe continued:\nAs I have already said, there is no more urgent revolutionary task than this in terms of the fundamental principle of activities of our Party and state that are orienting all the works of revolution and construction to firmly defending and ensuring the rights and interests of the people and constantly expanding the policy for the welfare of the people, irrespective of conditions and circumstances and at the present moment when the epochal regional changes have become the most important task and indispensable requirement for the comprehensive development of socialism and for the comprehensive national rejuvenation.\nWe must not try to assess characteristics and advantages of the Korean-style socialist system through some new streets built in the capital city and the material and cultural standards of its citizens, and we must not think that the recent successes are great ones as they have been achieved in the face of the unprecedentedly severe manifold difficulties.\nThis opinion and viewpoint are harmful to the development of the revolution.\nLike the principles of architectural engineering and structural mechanics, which high-rise and super-high-rise buildings need firm foundations, if the socialist system is to be consolidated under any circumstances, the foundation of the people\u2019s mind  for its advantages should be solid, and all the people should actively sympathize with it through their actual life, and the social system should be based on the desire of all the people to share their destiny with socialism to the last and defend it through generations.\nHe referred to the importance of the regional development policy on developing the cities, counties and rural areas, the regional bases and lowest units, in a substantial, material and planned way, which constitute the whole territory of the DPRK and support the state system of the DPRK, and continued:\nLike this, regional development has arisen as a matter of faith in socialism, not a simple economic and business issue, and a very important and urgent matter directly linked with the future of our revolution. Therefore, I convened an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau again, set forth the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy and attached the more important political significance to its powerful implementation as soon as the discussion of the work ended at the plenary meeting earlier this year.\nSome time ago, l indicated the new orientation towards accelerating the historic cause of regional rejuvenation by simultaneously building public health facilities, sci-tech dissemination bases and grain management facilities as well as regional-industry factories facilities in cities and counties.\nAs we rang the roar of artillery solemnly  to implement the regional development policy in the new era, we should carry out the planned tasks without fail while steadily expanding the successes made so far and thus confidently open up the full-scale enforcement stage of the ten-year revolution for realizing our Party\u2019s desire.\nIt is necessary to simultaneously produce the completed entities in twenty cities and counties without fail at the end of the year by putting spurs to the construction of regional-industry factories, which arises the primary task for implementing the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy.\nThe officers and men of the units at all levels who were mobilized in regional construction should direct all their efforts to perfectly completing the construction of regional-industry factories at the highest quality level, staking the dignity of the Party and the honour of the People\u2019s Army.\nAs the construction of regional-industry factories in 20 cities and counties has entered the demarcation of 90 percent so far, the units in charge of equipment manufacture and import should also push ahead with the work to perfectly carry out their tasks and supply equipment in time.\nLight industry factories and relevant universities in the capital city, and provinces, cities and counties should make a positive contribution to implementing our Party\u2019s policy on regional development by thoroughly and within the fixed date working out the plan for training technicians and skilled workers capable of managing and operating regional-industry factories to be built in a modern way.\nMinistries, national agencies and relevant provinces, cities and counties should prepare and supply raw materials needed for normalizing production as soon as regional-industry factories are completed.\nIt is very important for each city and county to create their reserves in translating the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy into reality and making it substantially contribute to improving the living standard of the regional people.\nSo, we took new measures to make a breakthrough in solving this problem by building the Sinpho City Offshore Farm as a model base for offshore cultivation and to revitalize its operation.\nReferring to the importance and significance of the construction of three projects newly added to the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy, he said that we are going to expand and build the centers for sci-tech learning, which had been already expected to be additional projects, into comprehensive bases for cultural life. And he underlined the need to building not only bases for sci-tech learning equipped with modern IT means but also multi-functional comprehensive cultural centers including trade networks and all sorts of service establishments with good hygienic environment in which inhabitants can watch films and lead a sports and cultural life in cities and counties and use the centers.\nHe went on:\nAs the comprehensive centre for cultural life is a new project which is the first conception in the history of regional construction, I will make sure that designs for architecture including layouts are properly made in consideration of the scale and characteristics according to topographic condition and population and a budget bill for construction is definitely drawn up on its basis.\nIf we spruce up 20 cities and counties every year like this, it may be that the differences between cities and rural areas that have lasted historically will be remarkably reduced and the living conditions of the regional people will become rich and civilized as good as the urban people.\nKim Jong Unstressed the need to continue to push ahead with the work for further consolidating the national defence capabilities as required by the present situation.\nAs the reckless expansion of the military bloc system led by the U.S. and its development into the character of a nuclear-based military bloc, the military security environment around the DPRK has come close to us as a grave threat.\nSuch actual threats will inevitably bring about more various threats in the future and, accordingly, such situational development requires us to take more important measures and make constant efforts to maintain and further boost military supremacy.\nThe obvious conclusion is that the nuclear force of the DPRK and the posture capable of properly using it for ensuring the state's right to security in any time should be more thoroughly perfected.\nWe are now perfectly carrying out the policy on building the nuclear armed forces on increasing the number of nuclear weapons by geometrical progression, and the nuclear combat forces of the Republic are being operated under the strict command and control system.\nOur state is a responsible nuclear weapons state.\nWe are constantly exposed to a serious nuclear threat. Our nuclear weapons for defending ourselves do not pose a threat to anyone.\nForces, which call the nuclear armed force of the DPRK threatening, only reveal their admission that they have the hostile intention to attack the DPRK with nukes.\nUnder the different threats posed by the United States and its followers and under the security circumstances facing us, the possession of powerful military power is the duty and right to existence that our Party and Government should not miss even a moment and make no concession.\nStrong power is just a genuine peace and an absolute guarantee for the development of our state.\nIt is the most important national affairs of the Party and the government and the first task of the revolution to constantly strengthen and develop our army' capability to fight a war and thus actively cope with the regional security environment and defend the sovereignty, security and interests of the state by dint of powerful strength.\nThe DPRK will steadily strengthen its nuclear force capable of fully coping with any threatening acts imposed by its nuclear-armed rival states and redouble its measures and efforts to make all the armed forces of the state including the nuclear force fully ready for combat.\nRepeatedly stating, the DPRK's military muscle will develop in an accelerated and continued way thanks to our aspiration and steady efforts and we will not set a limit to its attainment.\nHe said that the success of this year's struggle for providing a sure guarantee for implementing the decisions of the Party congress entirely depends on the responsibility and role of the party organizations and their officials, the political staff of the relevant units.\nToday our revolution expects that Party organizations and officials will work with devotion and work harder than ever before.\nThe organizations and officials of the whole Party should be well aware of the requirements of the revolution and their responsibilities and duties and bear deep in mind their mission and thus conduct energetic organizational and political work to carry out the tasks of this year\u2019s struggle unconditionally and correctly.\nFirst of all, they should examine in detail the political tasks assigned to their sectors and units and the implementation of the Party decisions adopted for their implementation, and take appropriate measures to ensure correct implementation.\nAnd they should intensify the control and guidance for their implementation and reassignment and conduct the work in a three-dimensional way and at a lightning speed.\nWhen all Party organizations and officials launch operation and guidance for unconditionally attaining this year's struggle goals in a sweeping and dynamic manner by giving full play to their organizing ability, leadership and executive faculty from the standpoint that they should be entirely responsible for the work of the fields and units under their charge, it is quite possible to bring about substantial results until the end of this year.\nIn particular, it is necessary to get rid of the wrong viewpoint and attitude of leaving the work for fulfilling this year's plans and goals entirely to the administrative officials and intensify the organization and control from the standpoint that Party committees take the full responsibility for it.\nThe fighting efficiency and activity of the Party organizations are gauged by their ability of inspiring mental power and wisdom of the masses.\nParty organizations at all levels should launch a vigorous ideological offensive to give full play to the patriotic enthusiasm and creative ingenuity of the producer masses by displaying a high sense of responsibility and making redoubled efforts, thus making sure that every part of the country seethes with enthusiasm and the collective innovation movement gets brisk in every unit.\nTo this end, it is necessary to instill into the Party members and other working people the viewpoint that the policy tasks facing their sectors and units are realistic and feasible struggle targets, which were set on the basis of enough calculation into overall conditions and possibility of their implementation, and that they must carry them out without fail in any case and they can do so, thus providing them with confidence and courage.\nWe should concentrate information and motivation means and forces on the sites of vibrant struggle and launch a vigorous ideological offensive without interruption, so that the intention and mind of the masses are all oriented towards attaining the target of this year\u2019s plan and the soaring enthusiasm for revolution and struggle never cools but steadily goes up at every workplace.\nIn successfully concluding this year\u2019s struggle, it is very important to encourage the officials and Party members, who are the organizers and executors of the Party\u2019s lines and policies, to give fuller play to their leadership, creativity and activity.\nParty organizations should intensify their guidance over the officials' Party life so that the officials make redoubled efforts and work harder to carry out successfully and perfectly the struggle goals, set for their sectors and units, out of a single resolve to repay the Party\u2019s trust with high work results.\nThe relevant departments of the WPK Central Committee and the Party organizations at all levels of ministries and national agencies in the government should supervise and actively encourage their leading cadres so that they are deeply conscious of their responsibilities, explore the ways to properly discharge their duties, as required by the Party policies, always in a keen sense of responsibility, and conduct operations and work in a meticulous and strenuous manner, fully aware of their heavy duty.\nParty organizations should strengthen the organization and guidance of Party life among their members so that they find themselves earlier than others in the most difficult jobs, which others may hesitate to do, lead the masses in a revolutionary and positive manner and stand in the vanguard of the struggle for resolutely eliminating all obstacles hindering our advance in every worksite seething with the efforts for implementing the Party decisions.\nIt is needed to further enhance the responsibility and role of the officials of power organs at all levels, and of leading economic officials, in particular.\nWe have not much time left until the end of this year, in which we should confirm the success in attaining the goal of struggle set forth by the Eighth Party Congress.\nIt is just the leading economic officials who should work more responsibly during the time left, which can be said to be decisive of the implementation of the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy.\nOfficials in charge of economic affairs should waste no time but concentrate on fulfilling their duties, aware that they have only 110-odd days until the expiry of the deadline for their pledge to implement the decision of the Ninth Plenary Meeting of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party without fail.\nSaying that all officials should conduct their work in a bold and innovative way with the spirit of ardently serving the country and the people and revolutionary optimism, he called for enhancing the function and role of law-enforcement organs in every way so as to make sure that the overall work of the state is conducted smoothly as required by the Party, the revolution, the people and the rapidly changing times. He went on:\nAs I mentioned earlier, this year our Party and government have designed and strongly propelled the gigantic and worthwhile undertakings for overall prosperity of the state and well-being of the people.\nAll these undertakings are not easy to carry out and we have not a few difficulties to overcome, but we must bring about remarkable results without fail with firm confidence and steadfast will, and thus glorify this year as a year of proud victory in the history of state development.\nLet us all wage a more vigorous struggle with greater pride and confidence in our efforts for accomplishing the sacred cause for peace, prosperity and grandeur of our motherland and well-being of the people throughout the country.\nI extend my warm best wishes to all citizens of this country once again and warmly congratulate them on the national day of the great motherland. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, September 10 (KCNA) --Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, made an important speech, titled, \"Let Us Make Redoubled Efforts for the Prosperity of Our Great State\", on September 9 to mark the 76th founding anniversary of the DPRK.\nIn the speech he extended warm greetings, on the occasion of the founding anniversary of the country, to the cadres of the Party and the government, who are working strenuously and with devotion to prove themselves worthy of the weighty responsibilities entrusted to them by the great people, and also to the service personnel and all the other people, who are proudly celebrating the national day with the dignity of displaying their pure and boundless patriotic loyalty and devoting untiring efforts in the dynamic, creative struggle for national prosperity.\nHe also expressed his good wishes towards all the overseas Koreans, including the patriotic compatriots of Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) who are invariably following the road of patriotism with ardent love for their socialist homeland, and he thanked the peoples of all the friendly countries for recognizing the sovereignty of the DPRK and supporting its cause of justice.\nHe then paid noble tribute to the revolutionary forerunners, patriotic martyrs and meritorious persons of the preceding generations, who had created excellent traditions and paradigms worthy of emulation for all posterity by dedicating their precious lives and performing remarkable feats for the founding and development of the country and the victorious advance of the socialist cause.\nHe continued to say:\nNo country in the world is as great, wonderful and glorious as our Republic\u2013this is what comes to our minds each time we look up, with a high sense of pride, at our national flag fluttering incessantly and shedding its brilliant radiance all over this land, and whenever we mark our national day every year.\nUnheard-of miracles were wrought by the Korean people during their fight to repulse the invasion by the imperialist allied forces boasting of their incomparably superior strength, to say nothing of the period when they were building a genuine people\u2019s country after being freed from the vicious colonial rule. And the historic stage of Chollima Korea, Juche Korea, during which they started from scratch on the war debris and made a leap forward towards the goal of building a socialist state, was also replete with such miracles.\nWe are taking greater pride in the fact that such an honourable course followed by our state is not confined to the history written by our preceding generations.\nThe reality, as we see today, is an extension of this miraculous past.\nObviously, we are progressing.\nOver the last period, when one whole generation has been replaced by another, our Party and people have defended and developed the socialist cause without any slightest vacillation or deviation in the face of countless severe challenges and trials. This constitutes the most faithful and perfect inheritance of the cause of Kimilsungism, a significant political victory and historic miracle that has proved in practice the everlasting truthfulness, veracity and vitality of the great Juche idea and its materialization\u2013socialism of our own style.\nIn this way we have clearly demonstrated to the whole world the truth of Juche, the immutable truth of invincibility, that socialism, whereby the people are its masters and remain faithful to their responsibility and role as such, will grow prosperous for all eternity without ever collapsing or vacillating in the face of the imperialist reactionary forces\u2019 desperate manoeuvres and the change of generations within our revolutionary ranks.\nThis year, too, our Party and government have organized and launched ambitious, gigantic projects, which will serve as a watershed in making an epoch-making advancement of our socialist cause.\nAs you all know, we are currently implementing the struggle tasks for the fourth year of the five-year plan as was decided upon and assigned by the Eighth Party Congress. Under these circumstances we have, of our own accord, resolved to add medium- and long-term tasks for regional rejuvenation to our work programme. This manifests our self-confidence and firm belief in our strength, the revolutionary viewpoint and attitude of our Party Central Committee in working to fulfil the responsibility and duty it has assumed for the times and history, and its steadfast spirit of serving the people.\nWe are overflowing with strong confidence in our ability to successfully and bravely pass through this challenging, historic stage of our revolutionary cause.\nThese revolutionary measures we have adopted recently are an important strategic decision designed to build up the foundations of our social system and accelerate the comprehensive development of our state by substantially displaying the advantages of socialism through the promotion of the well-being of the people throughout the country.\nAs things stand now, the country\u2019s economic situation is not good and it is difficult to find any more reserves. However, our current plan for the next ten years envisages helping all the cities and counties in the country have the major material and technical foundations for their diversified and independent development. This would be unthinkable in the past.\nNonetheless, in order to repay the people\u2019s great expectations and trust, our Party and government worked out a scientific strategy and realistic action plan as they believed in the unconditional and absolute loyalty of our service personnel and their strong fighting efficiency. Already, as we expected, major regional-industry factories are taking shape in the 20 cities and counties.\nNot content with this, our Party and government have proposed an additional initiative to rid regions of their backwardness as soon as possible, and they are currently making preparations for implementing it to the letter.\nProceeding from my view of the regional development policy as a key political concern, I have already stressed the need for our Party and government to regard regional development as their most pressing revolutionary task.\nThis is something that has eluded us for more than 70 years, nearly eight decades, so I am certain that there are some whose attitude and stand towards this regional development plan remain skeptical.\nNevertheless, availing myself of this opportunity, I reaffirm on behalf of the Party and the government.\nIs the fulfilment of our regional development policy guaranteed? Is it feasible to carry it through? It is feasible.\nTen years later, we will answer this question with real transformations.\nIt is also a success we are achieving that we are steadily pushing forward with the efforts to achieve the goals for readjustment and reinforcement for this year, while keeping the overall growth trend of the national economy and fulfilling without fail the monthly and quarterly production plans in different fields of the national economy, including key industries, despite manifold difficulties and obstacles,\nKim Jong Unsaid, and continued:\nThis year we have provided conditions for bringing about more improved and changed results in light industry, urban management and other sectors directly linked with stabilizing the people\u2019s livelihood. The crops are in good conditions as a whole so far, and there is expected to be fairly good harvests.\nWe can appreciate that a series of progresses have been made in supplementing and completing the functions and capabilities of the state for coping with the crises caused by natural disasters.\nSevere flooding hit some areas in North Phyongan Province along the lower reaches of the Amnok River and in Jagang and Ryanggang provinces in late July, which hindered the work of the state and required mobilization of huge forces for rehabilitation, but the Party and the government took it as an opportunity for making a new detailed survey of the shortcomings and gaps in coping with natural disasters and for taking prospective and irreversible measures to prevent them in the future. It can be called an important advance.\nEven in this situation, we have achieved great epochal results by vigorously promoting the radical development of the defence capabilities to create a reliable security environment of the country and conditions favourable for socialist construction.\nThis year, especially in some recent months, we have wonderfully built up our military strength by making important achievements in the research and production for national defence.\nWhen we comprehensively assess the present situation of all these state affairs, we can analyze that almost all the major extra policy-oriented tasks set forth by the Party Central Committee in planning and arranging this year\u2019s work are progressing successfully, correctly and satisfactorily.\nUrgent efforts should be made to further enrich and build on the successes achieved this year by making the most of the remaining months,Kim Jong Unsaid, and continued:\nThe most important thing to this end is to further raise and expand the boundless patriotism and loyalty of all the Party members and other working people and service personnel and lead these spirits to successful fruition.\nThis is just the important and essential revolutionary task facing the senior officials of our Party and government.\nWe should wind up in a responsible manner the economic work for this year aimed at making fresh progress in the efforts for the comprehensive national rejuvenation and further improving the material and cultural living standards of the people.\nSo far, almost all the fields of the national economy, which are in charge of the 12 major goals, have carried out their assignments without fail. The present fighting atmosphere and spirit are very good.\nIn order to maintain this trend in a sustainable way, it is necessary for all the fields and units of the national economy to actively apply skilful operations and innovative methods for giving the fullest play to the working people\u2019s enthusiasm for production and creativity and improving their technical level and skills.\nAnd by maintaining and repairing the existing equipment regularly, all the production sectors should prevent equipment breakdown, maximize the rate of their operation and ensure the quantitative and qualitative level of products through constant updating of production lines and equipment.\nReferring to the tasks to be tackled in fully ensuring stable production activities in the major fields of the national economy,Kim Jong Unwent on:\nThe Cabinet and the state economic guidance organs should learn about the implementation of all the measures the state has already taken to further increase its productivity by carrying out by the appointed time and without fail the plans of the key industries for readjustment and reinforcement to be completed within this year, and take decisive measures at an early date by identifying other problems and unsatisfactory elements.\nAs the development of the state and social life as well as the economy is mainly expressed as the entities of architectural structures, the construction sector must carry out this year\u2019s plan without fail with the main emphasis on ensuring their quality in a thoroughgoing way.\nIt should do so for the structures directly related to the actual life of the people, including the 10 000 flats under construction as the third-stage project in the Hwasong area and rural houses and, at the same time, raise the architectural design to the international level and make a remarkable change in the work of standardizing and modernizing construction equipment and tools.\nThe new hostels built in the city of Samjiyon should be turned into hotels and more tourist attractions be developed to make the city a world-class mountain resort and the projects for perfectly building the Wonsan-Kalma Coastal Tourist Area steadily pushed forward for their operation from next year.\nNoting that efforts should be directed to securing a firm guarantee for actively enhancing the abilities of control and command of the economy as a whole by decisively updating the economic means and methods for directing and managing the economy of the state in keeping with the development of the times and the requirements of the reality,Kim Jong Ununderlined the need for the state to attach importance to the smooth and comfortable circulation of products, to give priority to creating favourable conditions and environment for production and management activities based on the relative independence of enterprises and to take effective measures for continuously raising the real incomes of the working people.\nSaying that to carry out the grain production plan is not a task confined to the agricultural sector but political work to guarantee the victorious advance of socialism, he indicated the clear ways for successfully winding up this year\u2019s farming and making good preparations for next year\u2019s farming.\nKim Jong Unmade an analytical appraisal of what has been done up to now for the campaign of recovering from flood damage, and said:\nIt is true that we are pressed for time, there are so many objects to rehabilitate and the volume of construction is enormous, but we should never permit lowering of the quality of the structures.\nNow that enough reconstruction forces have been mobilized and the enthusiasm of the soldier-builders and shock brigade members is high enough, whether the projects are completed in time or not depends on how the building materials, equipment and vehicles are supplied.\nThe Cabinet, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Railways and other ministries and national agencies should supply steel materials, cement, fuel, timber, glass and other building materials and equipment as planned and in time as scheduled, and take decisive measures for easing the strain on transport so as to ensure smooth progress in the projects.\nWe should finish the rehabilitation campaign in a qualitative way within the fixed period and thus bring a normal and stable life to the inhabitants in the flood-hit areas and put the damaged sectors of the national economy back on their regular track so as to successfully complete the struggle with nature.\nKim Jong Unsaid that the prerequisite task the Party and the government should place particular importance on and push ahead with strongly is to implement the regional development policy in the new era in an unconditional and perfect way, and continued:\nAs I have already mentioned, there is no more urgent revolutionary task than this one whether it is seen from the fundamental principle of activities of our Party and state that are orienting all the work of the revolution and construction to firmly defending and ensuring the rights and interests of the people and constantly expanding the policies for their wellbeing whatever the conditions and circumstances may be and from the viewpoint of the current situation when epochal regional transformation has become the most important task and indispensable requirement for comprehensive development of socialism and comprehensive rejuvenation of the country.\nWe should not try to assess the characteristics and advantages of our style of socialist system by simply taking into consideration some new streets built in the capital city and the material and cultural standards of living of its citizens; we should all the more refrain from feeling proud that what we have done is a great success as we have achieved it in the face of the unprecedentedly severe, manifold difficulties.\nThis opinion and view are detrimental to the developing revolution.\nThe principle of architectural engineering and structural mechanics demands firm foundations for high-rise and super-high-rise buildings; likewise, the socialist system, if it is to remain consolidated under any circumstances, must be solid in its foundations of the people\u2019s conviction in its advantages, enjoy active empathy of all the people which they have got through their actual life, and rely on the unanimous will of the people to share their destiny with socialism to the last and defend it through generations.\nReferring to the importance of the regional development policy of developing in a substantial, material and planned way cities, counties and rural communities, the regional bases and terminal units, which constitute the integrated territory of the DPRK and support its state system, he said:\nLike this, regional development has risen as a matter of faith in socialism, instead of a simple economic and businesslike issue, and a very important and urgent matter that has a direct bearing on the future of our revolution. So I convened an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau again as soon as the plenary meeting finished its work earlier this year, and set forth the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy, to which I have attached paramount political importance to its powerful implementation.\nAnd recently, I indicated a new orientation towards accelerating the historic cause of regional rejuvenation by simultaneously building a public health institution, sci-tech dissemination base and grain management facility in each city and county along with regional-industry factories.\nThis year we solemnly declared the beginning of the campaign to implement the regional development policy in the new era, so we should carry out the planned projects without fail by steadily expanding the successes made so far, and thus definitely open up the stage of full-scale implementation of the ten-year revolution for realizing our Party\u2019s cherished desire.\nBy putting spurs to the construction of regional-industry factories, the primary task in implementing the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy, we should simultaneously present the completed entities in 20 cities and counties without fail at the end of the year.\nOfficers and men of the units at all levels, who are mobilized for regional construction, should direct all their efforts to perfectly completing the construction of regional-industry factories at the highest quality level, staking the dignity of the Party and the honour of the People\u2019s Army.\nAs the construction of regional-industry factories in 20 cities and counties has passed the line of 90 percent, the units in charge of equipment manufacture or import should now push ahead with their work to perfectly carry out their tasks and supply the equipment in time.\nCentrally-run light-industry factories, relevant universities, provinces, cities and counties should make an active contribution to implementing our Party\u2019s policy on regional development by carrying out within the fixed date the plan of training technicians and skilled workers capable of managing and operating the modern regional-industry factories to be built.\nMinistries, national agencies and relevant provinces, cities and counties should stock up on and supply enough raw materials needed for normal production at regional-industry factories as soon as their construction is completed.\nIn translating the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy into reality and making it contribute substantially to improving the regional people\u2019s standard of living, it is very important for each city and county to create their own reserves.\nSo, we took new measures to make a breakthrough in solving this problem by building the Sinpho City Offshore Farm as a model base for offshore farming and revitalizing its operation.\nReferring to the importance and significance of the three construction projects newly added to the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy,Kim Jong Unsaid:\nWe are going to build the sci-tech dissemination bases, which are intended as an additional project, into comprehensive bases for cultural life. We should build in cities and counties bases that not only are equipped with modern IT means for sci-tech learning but also serve multifunctional and complex cultural purposes, so that local residents can see films or play sports and amusement games there; and commercial outlets and various other welfare facilities with satisfactory hygienic environment and conditions are also to be furnished in them.\nAs the comprehensive centres for cultural life are a novel project never previously seen in the history of regional construction, I will make sure that their architectural designs including formation plans are properly made taking the sizes and characteristics into consideration according to the geographical conditions and populations of the regions and the budgets for their construction accurately drawn up on its basis.\nIf we spruce up 20 cities and counties every year like this, we can witness a drastic reduction in differences between urban and rural areas that have been handed down throughout history and a wealthy and civilized life of the regional people as good as that of urbanites.\nKim Jong Unstressed that we should continue to push ahead with the work for further consolidating the national defence capabilities as required by the present situation, and went on:\nWith the reckless manoeuvres of the US-led military bloc for expansion and its evolution to the one that is based on nukes, the military security environment around the DPRK has come closer to it as a grave threat.\nSuch imminent threats will inevitably invite more various threats in the future, and the consequential developments demand that we take more important measures and make consistent efforts to maintain and develop our military supremacy.\nThe obvious conclusion is that the nuclear force of the DPRK and its posture for being properly employed at any time in ensuring the state\u2019s right to security should be more thoroughly perfected.\nWe are now carrying out steadfastly the policy of building up our nuclear armed forces with exponential increase in the number of nuclear weapons, and our Republic\u2019s nuclear combat force is being operated under a strict command and control system.\nOurs is a responsible nuclear-armed state.\nThe nuclear weapons we have possessed in defence of ourselves, who are constantly exposed to a serious nuclear threat, do not pose a threat to any others.\nAny forces trumpeting about the threat by the nuclear armed force of the DPRK cannot but admit their hostile intention to attack the latter with nukes.\nUnder the different threats posed by the United States and its followers and the security circumstances facing us, the possession of a powerful military strength is the duty and the right to existence that our Party and government must neither neglect even a moment nor make the slightest concession to.\nStrong power\u2013this just means a genuine peace and an absolute guarantee for the development of our state.\nSteadily enhancing the capabilities of our army for fighting a war so as to cope with the regional security environment on its own initiative and to defend the sovereignty, security and interests of the state by dint of a powerful strength is the most important of the state affairs of our Party and government and the primary task of the revolution.\nThe DPRK will steadily bolster its nuclear force that is capable of effectively coping with any acts of threat imposed by its nuclear-armed rival states, and take measures and make redoubled efforts to maintain the perfect combat readiness of all the armed forces of the state including the nuclear force.\nI confirm again: Our Republic\u2019s military strength will develop in an accelerated and sustained way by dint of our aspiration and steady efforts, and we will not set a limit of its attainment.\nKim Jong Unsaid that the success of this year\u2019s struggle for providing a sure guarantee for implementing the decisions of the Party Congress entirely depends on the sense of responsibility and role of the Party organizations and their officials, the political staff of the relevant units.\nToday our revolution expects that Party organizations and officials will work more devotedly and proactively than ever before.\nThe organizations and officials of the whole Party, being well aware of the requirements of the revolution and their responsibilities and duties and bearing deep in mind their mission, should aggressively conduct organizational and political work to carry out this year\u2019s struggle tasks unconditionally and accurately.\nAbove all, they should examine in detail the policy-oriented tasks assigned to their sectors and units and progress in the implementation of their Party decisions adopted for the fulfillment of these tasks, and take appropriate measures to ensure their correct implementation.\nAnd they should conduct a stubborn three-dimensional and highly-intensive campaign while intensifying the control and guidance for their implementation and the reassigning.\nIt is quite possible to produce substantial results at the end of this year, if all the Party organizations and officials plan and oversee the work for unconditionally attaining this year\u2019s struggle goals at a lightning speed and in a dynamic manner by giving full play to their organizing, leadership and executive abilities from the standpoint of bearing full responsibility for the work of their sectors and units.\nIn particular, it is necessary for Party organizations to get rid of the wrong viewpoint and attitude of leaving the work for achieving this year\u2019s goals entirely to the administrative officials, and intensify organization, grasping and control from the standpoint of taking full responsibility for the work.\nThe fighting efficiency and active character of Party organizations are assessed by how fully they give play to the spiritual strength and wisdom of the masses.\nParty organizations at all levels should launch a vigorous ideological offensive aimed at giving full play to the patriotic enthusiasm and creative activity of the producer masses by displaying a high sense of responsibility and making redoubled efforts, so as to make the whole country bustle with activities and every unit conduct a more vigorous collective innovation movement.\nTo this end, they should instil into the Party members and other working people the viewpoint that the policy-oriented tasks facing their sectors and units are realistic and feasible struggle targets, which were set on the basis of a sufficient calculation of overall conditions and possibility of their implementation, and that they must carry them out without fail in any case and they can surely do so, so as to give them confidence and courage.\nThey should concentrate information and motivation means and forces on the sites of vibrant struggle to carry on a vigorous ideological offensive without a moment of interruption, so as to orient the intention and mind of the masses towards attaining the targets for this year and keep the surging enthusiasm for the revolution and struggle growing at every workplace.\nIn victoriously concluding this year\u2019s struggle, it is very important for the officials and Party members, who are the organizers and executors of the Party\u2019s lines and policies, to give fuller play to their initiative, creativity and activity.\nParty organizations should intensify guidance over the officials\u2019 Party life so that they redouble their efforts and exert themselves to substantially and perfectly attain the struggle goals set for their sectors and units with the single desire to live up to the Party\u2019s trust with exceptional results in their work.\nThe relevant departments of the Central Committee of the WPK and its organizations at all levels of ministries and national agencies in the government should render a proactive help to the leading cadres, while grasping and controlling their work so that they are deeply conscious of their responsibilities and duties, explore the ways to properly discharge their duties as required by the Party\u2019s policies always with a keen sense of responsibility, map out detailed plans and conduct their work in a persistent way.\nParty organizations should strengthen the organization and guidance of Party life among Party members so that they find themselves earlier than others in the most difficult jobs in every workplace seething with the struggle for implementing Party decisions, which others may hesitate to do, lead the masses in a revolutionary and positive manner and stand in the vanguard of the struggle for resolutely removing all the obstacles to our advance.\nOfficials of power organs at all levels, leading economic officials in particular, should further enhance their sense of responsibility and role.\nWe have not much time left until the end of this year, when we should confirm the feasibility of success in attaining the struggle goals set forth at the Eighth Party Congress.\nIt is just the leading economic officials who should work in a more responsible manner in the remaining period, which can be said to be decisive of the implementation of the five-year plan for the development of the national economy.\nThey should waste no time but dash forward to fulfil their duties, well aware that they have only 110-odd days until the target date of implementing without fail the decisions of the Ninth Plenary Meeting of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.\nSaying that all officials should conduct their work in a bold and innovative way with the spirit of ardently serving the country and the people and revolutionary optimism,\nKim Jong Uncalled for enhancing the functions and role of law-enforcement organs in every way so as to make sure that the overall work of the state is conducted smoothly as required by the Party, the revolution, the people and the rapidly changing times. He went on:\nAs I mentioned earlier, this year our Party and government designed and have pushed ahead with the gigantic and worthwhile undertakings for the comprehensive rejuvenation of the state and the well-being of the people.\nEvery undertaking is not easy to carry out and faces enormous difficulties to overcome, but we must achieve remarkable results without fail with firm confidence and steadfast will, and thus glorify this year as a year of proud victories in the history of the development of our state.\nLet us all wage a more vigorous struggle with renewed dignity and confidence in accomplishing the sacred cause for the peace, prosperity and great glory of our motherland and the well-being of the people throughout the country.\nI once again extend my best wishes to all citizens of this country and warmly congratulate them on the national day of our great motherland. -0-",

This is an insult to the inviolable UN and the UN Charter and one more important occasion judging who is the illegal force inciting military conflict in the Korean peninsula.\nA \"joint statement\" adopted after the meeting shows that the U.S. is buckling down to drawing member states of the \"UN Command\" into different joint military drills of aggressive nature to make them proficient in its-led war scenario and substantially enhance their capabilities to fight a war.\nTerming the U.S. and its vassal forces' confrontational movement an extremely dangerous political and military provocation that causes security imbalance and escalates the danger of war in the Korean peninsula and the region, we resolutely denounce and reject it.\nThe expansion of the \"UN Command\" is a prelude to the establishment of \"NATO of Asian version\" which will result in pushing the Asia-Pacific region deeper into the structure of new cold war, not easing the military tensions in the Korean peninsula and the region.\nWhen taking into consideration the fact that the revival of the \"UN Command\" is further increasing the possibility of military conflict in the Korean peninsula by stirring up the war hysteria of the ROK military gangsters running amuck in the military confrontation with the DPRK, the danger of such moves can never be overlooked.\nMoreover, if countries in different regions take part in the moves to revive the \"UN Command\", blindly following the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, military conflict in the Korean peninsula will not be confined to the one between the DPRK and the U.S. but will inevitably lead to the start of a new world war.\nIt is an essential requirement for the national security and the region's peaceful development to steadily improve the strategic force capable of deterring and weakening the hostile countries' will for war provocation.\nThe U.S. and its vassal countries' collective military confrontation against the DPRK will serve as a motive and catalyst for accelerating the formation and development of a just strategic axis that thoroughly disallows the imbalance of power in the Korean peninsula and the region.\nThe DPRK will steadily take a new strategic counteraction to contain and frustrate the reckless confrontation moves of the hostile forces to disturb peace and stability in the Korean peninsula by mobilizing the illegal war organization. -0-",

They fully demonstrated the fighting mettle and spirit of the invincible revolutionary armed forces that are able to really fight and surely win victory if they fight in the training conducted in the presence ofKim Jong Un.\nWatching with satisfaction the soldiers who are fully versed in the Juche-based and modern combat methods and are sweeping the training ground like lightning, he highly praised all the combatants for growing up to be stout and brave one-match-for-a-hundred combatants with the revolutionary and strong training enthusiasm and thoroughly maintaining the sure war posture.\nSaying that he felt assured and proud to see the soldiers prepared as brave fighters  like bullets, he encouraged the combatants who have grown up to be reliable guards and passionate warriors of the KPA which is demonstrating only victory, and had a photo session with them.\nThe combatants were full of boundless emotion, joy, great pride and self-esteem, turning into enthusiastic cheers like thunder, as they received high appreciation and great honor under the warm loving care of the invincible and iron-willed brilliant commander.\nSaying that as seen in today\u2019s training, such competent and stalwart fighters are needed in the KPA, he gave important instructions calling for more firmly building up the special operation armed force of the KPA by training possessors of a-match-for-a-hundred spirit and  core combatants capable of wiping out the enemy while courageously sweeping the battlefield where bullets and shells rain thick and fast without an inch of hesitation in case of emergency.\nWhen considering the mood and character of a modern war, to put forward the well-trained and prepared special operation armed force as the main combat force in the battlefield has an important influence on victory and defeat, and the building of special operation armed force is an important component in building the armed forces of the DPRK, he said, and set forth the militant task to put main efforts into strengthening the elite Korean-style special operation armed force by firmly holding fast to the revolution in training, ideas and equipment.\nNoting that the first task is to continue to intensify the drills for real war, he said that as emphasized always, a lot of sweat in training is the way to shed less blood in a war, war is not a premeditated one and, therefore, the KPA should be fully ready to check the enemy at once and mercilessly and completely repress them even if a war breaks out at once today, and it is the first patriotism and loyalty to the state and people and the foremost revolutionary duty for the soldiers to devote their all to the intensive drills for a real war.\nHe said with decision that it is necessary to continue to make strict demands in training, steadily improve the contents and methods of Korean-style training and make full preparations for war so as to make the enemies shed blood when they encounter with the KPA in an emergency.\nSaying that it is impossible to think about the victory of the army which is not possessed of the might of ideology and the well-prepared army with no ideology is nothing but undisciplined army and when soldiers become true patriotic soldiers who know the Party, the country and the people before learning about battles, victory always comes to their side, he called for more wonderfully cultivating and giving full play to the political and ideological advantages peculiar to the KPA and thus preparing the soldiers more firmly as the strongest in mental power.\nSaying that in intensifying the ideological education among the service personnel, class education is an important task which can never be neglected even a moment, he called for intensifying the education in an offensive way to make all the service personnel cherish the transparent sense of the enemy and their outlook on the arch enemy as their faith.\nThe revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK in which the whole ranks were prevailed by the indomitable heroic spirit and fighting spirit that no army in the world can imitate will grow stronger in the future, too and will become war deterrents making the enemy not dare to provoke, being afraid of its prestige and entity alone, he stressed.\nAll the combatants were filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and high spirit to become the best standard-bearers who defend our state and people most honorably and most reliably in the vanguard of the advance always by striving to build more perfect capability for real war with a firm patriotic spirit, bearing in mind the great trust and expectation ofKim Jong Unwho visited their training ground and gave them the ever-victorious war method and militant encouragement. -0-",

It is the primary patriotism and loyalty to the state and people and the foremost revolutionary duty for armed soldiers to devote their all to the intensive actual war drills, he said.\nHe conclusively said that it is necessary to continue to make strict demands in training and constantly improve the contents and methods of Korean-style training so as to get fully ready for war and thereby compel the enemies to shed blood when they encounter the KPA soldiers in case of emergency.\nSaying that victory of an army is unthinkable if it is not possessed of the might of ideology, he stated that even a well-prepared army is nothing but an undisciplined army if it has no ideology and that victory will always on the side of the servicemen when they become genuinely patriotic soldiers who know the Party, the country and the people before knowing how to fight. He called for more wonderfully cultivating and giving full play to the political and ideological advantages peculiar to the KPA and thus preparing the soldiers more firmly as the strongest in mental power.\nIn intensifying ideological education among the service personnel, class education is an important task which should never be neglected even a moment, he said, calling for conducting the education in an offensive way to make all the service personnel keep as an element of their faith the unwavering anti-enemy consciousness and view of the principal enemy.\nAn indomitable and heroic character and fighting spirit that no other army in the world can imitate pervade all the ranks of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK and they will grow stronger in the future, too, and become a war deterrent preventing the enemy from provoking, being afraid of them for their reputation and entity alone, he said with confidence.\nAll the combatants were filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and high spirit to become the first standard-bearers who always defend the DPRK and its people most honourably and reliably in the vanguard of the advance by striving to build more perfect capability for fighting an actual war with a firm patriotic spirit, bearing in mind the great trust and expectation ofKim Jong Unwho visited their training ground to tell them ever-victorious war methods and give them militant encouragement. -0-",

But it is nothing but flowery words to patronize its exclusive policy on strengthening the alliance.\nThe Korean peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region are plunged into a more unstable situation due to the confrontational behavior of the U.S. that is resorting to the Cold War way of thinking and inter-camp confrontation which are totally opposed to the desire of mankind for global peace and stability.\n\nU.S. which thrust dagger onto its ally's back\n\nAs regards AUKUS, fabricated on September 15, 2021, the French foreign minister strongly denounced it as an act of thrusting a dagger onto the ally\u2019s back, not a matter of scrapping the submarine contract which had been pushed forward between France and Australia.\nThe Biden administration had been advertising the \"importance of alliance and the strengthened alliance\", arguing that \"the U.S. has come back\". But the fact that it suddenly betrayed its ally in Europe is still now sparking off great shock and doubts of the international community.\nHowever, the appearance of Australia changing as an outpost for the U.S. and the move of AUKUS widening its fence give an answer to a question why the U.S. thrust a dagger onto the back of France.\nFirstly, the U.S. is turning Australia into a powerful military ally capable of containing independent and sovereign states in the Asia-Pacific region through the transfer of nuclear-powered submarine technology.\nThe U.S., together with the UK, is taking the lead in helping Australia possess a fleet composed of eight nuclear-powered submarines by 2055 and has expanded the ultra-modern military technology cooperation among three countries into the development of hypersonic weapons, eased the restrictions of military technology and arms export and built on an extensive scale facilities for operating its nuclear strategic assets and ultra-modern military hardware in Australia from 2022.\nIt has systematically delivered weapons and equipment such as Tomahawk cruise missiles, ship-to-air interceptor missiles and attack helicopters to Australia and supported the manufacture and export of missiles in Australia.\nSecondly, the U.S. is trying to develop AUKUS into a multilateral military bloc in which more allies are involved.\nNow, the officials concerned of the U.S. administration, whenever they have the opportunity, repeatedly claim that the door to AUKUS is open to the partners if they judge it is proper for them to join it.\nThe U.S.-Britain-Australia tripartite defense authority talks in April made public a \"joint statement\" on examining a proposal for promoting cooperation between AUKUS and Japan in the field of ultra-modern technology. And the U.S.-Japan summit held in Washington agreed on the issue on the cooperation between AUKUS and Japan in eight fields of core defence technology including artificial intelligence and cyber.\nThe U.S. is also mulling involving the ROK, New Zealand, Canada and other allies into AUKUS in the capacity of \"partners\", saying that it is necessary for AUKUS to cooperate more closely with such countries as the ROK in the Indo-Pacific region.\nAll facts go to prove that the U.S. thrust a dagger onto the back of its ally, proceeding from a politically-motivated calculation to expand relations of alliance with its vassal forces into a multilateral military bloc based on nuclear weapons and secure a strategic superior in the region.\n\nAUKUS arousing backlash from international community\n\nAs soon as AUKUS made its ill-natured appearance, it has been the target of denunciation and rejection by many countries.\nRussia denounced the U.S. and its allies for pursuing a long-term confrontation in the region, terming AUKUS \"NATO of Asian version\".

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, September 14 (KCNA) -- The full text of an article contributed by Kim Myong Chol, an international affairs analyst, titled \"The exclusive expansion of bloc will only accelerate the U.S. strategic defeat\" says:\nThree years have passed since the U.S. cooked up the exclusive nuclear security technology alliance system AUKUS with Britain and Australia.\nThe past three years are the period in which the true colors of AUKUS have been clearly proved as a serious threat to the nuclear non-proliferation system, a propellant of arms race and a disturber of the regional strategic balance.\nThe U.S. is insisting that AUKUS is not targeting any specific country and has no effect on the nuclear non-proliferation system. But it is nothing but flowery words to patronize its exclusive policy on strengthening the alliance.\nThe Korean peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region are plunged into a more unstable situation due to the confrontational behavior of the U.S. that is resorting to the Cold War way of thinking and inter-camp confrontation which are totally opposed to the desire of mankind for global peace and stability.\n\nU.S. which thrust dagger onto its ally's back\n\nAs regards AUKUS, fabricated on September 15, 2021, the French foreign minister strongly denounced it as an act of thrusting a dagger onto the ally\u2019s back, not a matter of scrapping the submarine contract which had been pushed forward between France and Australia.\nThe Biden administration had been advertising the \"importance of alliance and the strengthened alliance\", arguing that \"the U.S. has come back\". But the fact that it suddenly betrayed its ally in Europe is still now sparking off great shock and doubts of the international community.\nHowever, the appearance of Australia changing as an outpost for the U.S. and the move of AUKUS widening its fence give an answer to a question why the U.S. thrust a dagger onto the back of France.\nFirstly, the U.S. is turning Australia into a powerful military ally capable of containing independent and sovereign states in the Asia-Pacific region through the transfer of nuclear-powered submarine technology.\nThe U.S., together with the UK, is taking the lead in helping Australia possess a fleet composed of eight nuclear-powered submarines by 2055 and has expanded the ultra-modern military technology cooperation among three countries into the development of hypersonic weapons, eased the restrictions of military technology and arms export and built on an extensive scale facilities for operating its nuclear strategic assets and ultra-modern military hardware in Australia from 2022.\nIt has systematically delivered weapons and equipment such as Tomahawk cruise missiles, ship-to-air interceptor missiles and attack helicopters to Australia and supported the manufacture and export of missiles in Australia.\nSecondly, the U.S. is trying to develop AUKUS into a multilateral military bloc in which more allies are involved.\nNow, the officials concerned of the U.S. administration, whenever they have the opportunity, repeatedly claim that the door to AUKUS is open to the partners if they judge it is proper for them to join it.\nThe U.S.-Britain-Australia tripartite defense authority talks in April made public a \"joint statement\" on examining a proposal for promoting cooperation between AUKUS and Japan in the field of ultra-modern technology. And the U.S.-Japan summit held in Washington agreed on the issue on the cooperation between AUKUS and Japan in eight fields of core defence technology including artificial intelligence and cyber.\nThe U.S. is also mulling involving the ROK, New Zealand, Canada and other allies into AUKUS in the capacity of \"partners\", saying that it is necessary for AUKUS to cooperate more closely with such countries as the ROK in the Indo-Pacific region.\nAll facts go to prove that the U.S. thrust a dagger onto the back of its ally, proceeding from a politically-motivated calculation to expand relations of alliance with its vassal forces into a multilateral military bloc based on nuclear weapons and secure a strategic superior in the region.\n\nAUKUS arousing backlash from international community\n\nAs soon as AUKUS made its ill-natured appearance, it has been the target of denunciation and rejection by many countries.\nRussia denounced the U.S. and its allies for pursuing a long-term confrontation in the region, terming AUKUS \"NATO of Asian version\". China censured AUKUS for threatening a regional peace and stability and sparking arms race as a security mechanism acting according the baton of the U.S.\nMeanwhile, the Southeast Asian countries neighboring Australia asserted that big powers should not do an act of infringing upon the interests of other countries with high-handed practice, saying that the Australian government is playing a \u201crole of the police\u201d of the U.S. in the region.\nMany media and experts on security are expressing the concerns that the fabrication of AUKUS is little short of opening the \"nuclear box of Pandora\".\nThe assertion of regional countries and experts is by no means groundless.\nThe fact that 160 nuclear warheads can be manufactured with highly enriched uranium, the fuel for the nuclear-powered submarines to be transferred to Australia, shows that the activities of AUKUS are very likely to lead to Australia's nuclear armament.\nAnd the reality proves that the U.S. is further inciting the wild ambition of the regional allies including Japan and the ROK for nuclear weaponization as it is transferring nuclear-powered submarines and their technology to Australia.\nThe \u201cdesire for joining\u201d AUKUS is growing with each passing day among Japan, ROK and other satellites of the U.S. and it predicts that the international nuclear non-proliferation system will be hardly hit in succession.\nThe exclusive and confrontational nature of AUKUS targeting a third country is further arousing the caution of regional countries.\nThe U.S. claimed that AUKUS does not target a special state in an early period but, recently, is not hiding the fact that AUKUS targets the independent and sovereign states in the region.\nHigh-ranking officials of the U.S. administration said that AUKUS regards China, Russia and the DPRK as the \"threats\" to the India-Pacific region, revealing the black-hearted intention of the U.S. to contain sovereign states through AUKUS.\nViewing the reality in which the U.S. is resorting to its \"lattice-like fence alliance\" policy on organically combining its allies across the world, it is a matter of time for AUKUS to merge with the U.S.-led political and military blocs including the U.S.-Japan-ROK triangular military bloc, SQUAD and QUAD. And it will further fix the structure of the new Cold War in the region.\nThis is a clear reason why the international community is expressing strong repugnance and caution against AUKUS.\n\nWashington's policy on expanding blocs accelerates its strategic defeat\n\nThe present U.S. administration is loudly advertising the fabrication and expansion of various blocs like AUKUS as its \"diplomatic achievements\", claiming that it is promoting the U.S. strategic value and interests.\nBut if anyone with an elementary understanding of the external crisis facing the U.S., he will know with ease that the above-said claim is very cross-sectional.\nIn January this year, the U.S. magazine National Interest said that the U.S. is being put in a dilemma for its excessive interference in various regional issues and the expanded friction of regional countries resulted from it. It raised the question \"Still is the U.S. the only superpower in the world?\"\nAs a matter of fact, the U.S. policy on expanding its alliance, which is being enforced worldwide, is further weakening its strength and exposing it to a more critical situation.\nFirst of all, the debt crisis of the U.S. is getting more serious day by day as the present U.S. administration is spending an astronomical amount of money on the arms buildup for maintenance and expansion of blocs and on the operation of overseas military bases and is running high fever in the military support for pro-U.S. states including Israel and Ukraine.\nThe U.S. impudent patronage for its allies, which are resorting to military confrontation and massacre of civilians, is leading to the decline in its influence in the region and serving as a catalyst for inciting anti-U.S. sentiments across the world.\nIn particular, the U.S. moves for the confrontation between camps to encircle and contain independent and sovereign states through the establishment of the global military alliance are compelling sovereign states to bolster up their self-defensive strength in every way and form and strengthen the just strategic axis for suppressing and foiling the aggressive military blocs.\nThis predicts that the more desperately the U.S. resorts to its policy on expanding blocs, the more it will plunge into an inescapable strategic maze.\nThe appearance of the U.S. seeking the confrontation between camps reminds one of the old Roman Empire which had been doomed to ruin, not the \"only superpower\".\nThe just international community will never tolerate the U.S. confrontation moves of violating peace and stability in the region and the rest of the world through its reckless policy for hegemony and bloc expansion but will counter them with strong strength.\nWashington\u2019s exclusive bloc expansion will be a decisive factor in accelerating the U.S. strategic defeat. -0-",

They finally choose the fate of calm death while leading a lonely life, separated from their families.\nAccording to the data released by the Police Agency of Japan recently, 37 227 people died while living alone from January to June this year.\nOf them, 28 330 people were aged over 65, accounting for 76.1%.\nThis is an inevitable phenomenon in Japan where the way of thinking \"parents are needed for money\" and the social climate based on it prevail.\nIt is an everyday occurrence in Japan that a son strangled his old father to death and a daughter killed her old mother for the reason that it is difficult to take care of her. It is obvious that it is not easy to die in peace in such a devil society where parents were sentenced to \"death\" by their children.\nOf course, there are such social \"protection facilities\" as \"the old people\u2019s welfare service facilities\" and \"the old people\u2019s homes\", but they are more terrible.\nNumerous old persons were killed in different parts of Japan. An employee of an old people\u2019s welfare service facility, who became irritated by taking care of an 81-year-old person, beat the person to death and an old people's home killed an old person by injecting poisonous medicine in order to take away the remaining money.\nIt is foolish for the old people, who are exposed to the threat of life while being subject to maltreatment even by their children, to think that they will entrust their destiny to others.\nThe old people who cannot find a safe place and are in the position of losing their lives by their children are, after all, choosing a comfortable \"lonely life\". Such phenomena are rampant day by day.\nIn a word, the single life of the old in Japan is a choice of the last resort to avoid \"death penalty\" by social evil.\nAll facts go to prove that the Japanese society where the old have to spend the last years of their life as days of horror and pain called the \"stay period of execution of death penalty\" is a theatre of evil virtues, debris of human ethics and a veritable hell. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, September 29 (KCNA) -- G7 has turned into the most hideous confrontational group against the DPRK under the control of the U.S.\nFor a typical example, its foreign ministers issued a \"presidential statement\" at a confab held on Sept. 24, occasioned by the 79th UN General Assembly session in New York.\nThe statement is run through with ridiculous and impudent remarks urging the DPRK to abandon its nuclear arms, not content with terming its self-defensive nuclear force an \"illegal one that violated UNSC resolutions.\"\nThis is just bombast urging the DPRK to dismantle its absolute guarantee for national security and give up its right to existence. Furthermore, it is a grave politically-motivated provocation and wanton violation which denies the sovereignty of the DPRK and the constitutional status that reflects the unanimous will of all the Korean people.\nThe DPRK has already specified the policy of its state nuclear force as its supreme law, a political and institutional mechanism for firmly guaranteeing the eternal security of the country and its people.\nG7 comprises a war criminal nation, which used A-bombs against humanity, possessed of the world's biggest nuclear arsenal, countries that armed themselves with nuclear weapons long ago with black-hearted intentions and a dangerous nation seeking nuclear weapons to realize their revengeful wild ambition.  Nevertheless, it tried to deprive the DPRK of its inalienable right to arming itself with self-defensive nuclear means. This constitutes the worst crime that can never be pardoned.\nG7 has persisted in seriously threatening the security environment of the DPRK.\nThe U.S. and Japan have frantically staged various war drills aimed at the use of nuclear weapons against the DPRK on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity, operating their triangular military alliance with the ROK in full swing. Worse still, other member states of G7 have joined one after another in the racket for stifling the DPRK. This clearly proves that G7 is a \"group that deserves a special prize\" for tangibly \"contributing\" to destroying peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the region.\nNo wonder, G7 member states are most active in taking part in the U.S.-led campaign for reviving and expanding the illegal \"UN Command\" in a bid to gain the right to their participation in the \"second Korean war,\" and among them are defeated nations of the Second World War.\nAgainst this backdrop, they held a confab during a UN General Assembly session discussing the tragic situations of Europe and the Middle East, where they called for someone's \"denuclearization\" that had flied far. This is just a revelation of their dead-end wild ambition for depriving the DPRK of its nuclear deterrent for self-defence at any cost under the manipulation of the U.S.\nG7 is foolish enough to deny the national law of the DPRK as it has neither qualifications nor authority to represent the international community.\nThough belatedly, it has to know that its any attempt against our nuclear weapons can never work.\nMoreover, they should know that the DPRK will never give up its nuclear weapons in any case.\nAll the people of the DPRK will defend their constitution at the cost of their lives.\nWe warn G7 not to stick to such a futile deed.\nG7 will have to pay dearly for violating the national law of the DPRK. -0-",

It is also an irresponsible act of making many people stake their lives on luck only, exposed to a great calamity.\nCalamity is inevitable unless insanity of Zelenskiy is stopped.\nThe U.S., though belatedly, should know that it can get a mere chance for preventing the looming calamity only when it cools down its head heated with anti-Russia confrontational hysteria and takes a step back after abandoning such a foolish and silly guy as Zelenskiy seeking to strike the interior of Russia, a nuclear superpower.\nTaking this opportunity, I would like to give a serious warning over Zelenskiy's backbiting against the DPRK at a recent UNSC meeting.\nThe malicious Zelenskiy clique, who has killed innocent Russian citizens by recklessly using the good-for-nothing weapons offered by the U.S. and the West, has gone so preposterous as to let out a string of rubbish terming our country an \"accomplice nation\" in the Ukrainian war. This is a reckless politically-motivated provocation that can never be justified.\nAs for the logic of Zelenskiy, the U.S. and the West deserve the title of top-class accomplice for having lavished the greatest amounts of weapons and ammunitions on the Ukrainian battlefields.\nThe world began to feel bored with the poor acting of Zelenskiy.\nIt is uncertain what he would do more with begging and sympathy but he'd better step down for world peace and security before it would be too late.\nHistory is on the side of justice.\nThe U.S. and its followers are bound to pay dearly for pursuing high-handedness and challenging justice. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, September 29 (KCNA) -- G7 has turned into the most hideous confrontational group against the DPRK under the control of the U.S.\nFor a typical example, its foreign ministers issued a \"presidential statement\" at a confab held on Sept. 24, occasioned by the 79th UN General Assembly session in New York.\nThe statement is run through with ridiculous and impudent remarks urging the DPRK to abandon its nuclear arms, not content with terming its self-defensive nuclear force an \"illegal one that violated UNSC resolutions.\"\nThis is just bombast urging the DPRK to dismantle its absolute guarantee for national security and give up its right to existence. Furthermore, it is a grave politically-motivated provocation and wanton violation which denies the sovereignty of the DPRK and the constitutional status that reflects the unanimous will of all the Korean people.\nThe DPRK has already specified the policy of its state nuclear force as its supreme law, a political and institutional mechanism for firmly guaranteeing the eternal security of the country and its people.\nG7 comprises a war criminal nation, which used A-bombs against humanity, possessed of the world's biggest nuclear arsenal, countries that armed themselves with nuclear weapons long ago with black-hearted intentions and a dangerous nation seeking nuclear weapons to realize their revengeful wild ambition.  Nevertheless, it tried to deprive the DPRK of its inalienable right to arming itself with self-defensive nuclear means. This constitutes the worst crime that can never be pardoned.\nG7 has persisted in seriously threatening the security environment of the DPRK.\nThe U.S. and Japan have frantically staged various war drills aimed at the use of nuclear weapons against the DPRK on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity, operating their triangular military alliance with the ROK in full swing. Worse still, other member states of G7 have joined one after another in the racket for stifling the DPRK. This clearly proves that G7 is a \"group that deserves a special prize\" for tangibly \"contributing\" to destroying peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the region.\nNo wonder, G7 member states are most active in taking part in the U.S.-led campaign for reviving and expanding the illegal \"UN Command\" in a bid to gain the right to their participation in the \"second Korean war,\" and among them are defeated nations of the Second World War.\nAgainst this backdrop, they held a confab during a UN General Assembly session discussing the tragic situations of Europe and the Middle East, where they called for someone's \"denuclearization\" that had flied far. This is just a revelation of their dead-end wild ambition for depriving the DPRK of its nuclear deterrent for self-defence at any cost under the manipulation of the U.S.\nG7 is foolish enough to deny the national law of the DPRK as it has neither qualifications nor authority to represent the international community.\nThough belatedly, it has to know that its any attempt against our nuclear weapons can never work.\nMoreover, they should know that the DPRK will never give up its nuclear weapons in any case.\nAll the people of the DPRK will defend their constitution at the cost of their lives.\nWe warn G7 not to stick to such a futile deed.\nG7 will have to pay dearly for violating the national law of the DPRK. -0-",

It said that if a school makes pupils like to die, they should not allow to go to it.\nThe opening day of the school term to be full of pleasure and hope serves as an occasion of nightmare encouraging pupils to commit suicide in the Japanese society.\nThe schools, inviolable places in which children should learn to their heart\u2019s content and bring their abilities into bloom, have turned into \"torture grounds\" where children suffer from intolerable mental and physical pain.\nSchools do not take the stand to prevent violence and maltreatment and protect children but ignore and encourage them.\nOne can know well the poor situation of the Japanese schools only through a suicide case of a schoolgirl of a middle school in Hyogo Prefecture that had been proven some years ago.\nThe schoolgirl submitted to the school even a document to complain of her distress and ask for the school's help in order to get rid of the torture from an extracurricular club.\nHowever, the school turned down her request by tearing the document into pieces and had connived at violence, leading her to commit suicide.\nIt also did not made a proper survey of her death but made public some contents, covering the motive of her miserable suicide for several years.\nIn February, a schoolgirl of a middle school in Nagasaki Prefecture committed suicide after writing her will to cry for  maltreatment in the campus. This tragedy was discovered through media's coverage in April.\nFrom January to June this year, 229 students of primary, middle and high schools in Japan committed suicides, exceeding the number of suicide cases in the same period of last year.\nWhenever such a tragic fact related to children is open to the public, the Japanese authorities often promise \"improvement\" while talking about \"gigantic\" plans such as \"strategy for future of children\".\nBut the plight of children is getting worse owing to social evils and they abandon even their dream of learning and choice death.\nThe reality goes to prove that the \"organizer\" of the tragic crime of leading children to commit suicide is none other than the Japanese authorities and social system.\nJapan in which the jungle law is rampant even in the sacred campus is, indeed, a tundra of human rights without future. -0-",

And, this time, B-1B bomber, one of the three air strategic assets of the U.S. Air Force, will be reportedly to fly in the sky above the Korean peninsula and conduct a demonstration flight, timed to coincide with a military parade on the \u201cROK army day\u201d.\nThe U.S. bluffing military demonstration is nothing but a \"hallucinant\" to save even a bit its military face driven into a strategic disadvantage in the Korean peninsula and calm down a sense of collapse of its stooge having a poor sleep at night from chronic nuclear phobia.\nIn June the U.S. B-1Bs flew over the sky of the Korean peninsula to stage a joint air drill with military gangsters of the ROK and a precision guided bomb dropping drill for the first time in several years. And nuclear carrier Theodore Roosevelt entered the Pusan operational base to insist on the \"combined defence posture\" and \"demonstration of extended deterrence\". All those facts clearly show where the intemperate hysteric confrontation racket of the ROK is based on.\nThe Korean People's Army (KPA) is keenly watching the frequent deployment of U.S. strategic assets and their traces in the Korean peninsula and is fully ready to thoroughly defend the security environment of the state from any threat.\nIt is the invariable stand of KPA that the U.S. which is seized with violence and high-handed practices, should be governed from the stand of strength.\nNow that the U.S. unannounced deployment of strategic assets has fixed as an incurable bad habit, a measure of unpredictable strategic nature corresponding to it should be an inevitable and legitimate right of a sovereign state, and fresh methods of adding serious concern to the security of the U.S. mainland should be surely produced.\nWe can examine such fresh action plans any time and carry them out.\nThe armed forces of the DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to the military provocative acts of the hostile forces escalated in three dimensions in the Korean peninsula and its vicinities, but take a thoroughgoing action corresponding to them and steadily improve their powerful war deterrent capable of initiatively coping with any instable situation of security caused by the U.S. irresponsible acts. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, October 2 (KCNA) -- The First National Conference of Officials in the Personnel Administration Sector took place in Pyongyang, the capital city of the DPRK.\nThe conference was aimed at taking practical steps to turn the personnel administration into a scientific and efficient one accelerating the advance and development of the DPRK in line with the requirements of the times when a new heyday of strengthening the entire Party is being ushered in, while clearly proving the validity and vitality of the five-point   Party-building line in the new era.\nBased on analyzing and reviewing in depth the successes and experience achieved in the personnel administration sector at present, the deviations, aftereffects and causes, the conference sincerely discussed practical issues for bringing about a fresh improvement in implementing the Party's policy on bringing about a new turn in the personal administration sector.\nPresent there were secretaries of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, officials of the relevant departments of the WPK Central Committee, senior officials and officials in charge of the personnel administration of provincial, city and county Party committees, the Party committees performing similar functions, ministries, national agencies and armed forces organs, and officials in charge of personal administration of industrial establishments.\nThe national anthem of the DPRK was played after the conference was declared open.\nThe letter sent byKim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, to the participants in the First National Conference of Officials in the Personnel Administration Sector was courteously conveyed.\nReceiving with great emotion the great immortal programme clearly indicating the outstanding ideology and theory and ways for reliably guaranteeing the overall development of the Party building, state building and socialist construction by making a fundamental innovation in the personnel administration of the new era, all the participants broke into loud applauses, reflecting their firm pledge to fulfill their responsibility and duty entrusted by the times, the revolution, the Party and the people in the struggle for qualitatively strengthening the ranks of cadres with a new mind of standing in the starting point for bringing about a new turn in the personal administration sector.\nA report was made at the conference.\nThe reporter said that the respected ComradeKim Jong Unput forward the personnel administration as an important issue decisive of the destiny and future of the Party and state, clearly indicated the principled issues arising in building up the ranks of cadres in a qualitative way and energetically led the work to break the outdated pattern latent in the personnel administration and bring about a fresh turn as required by the times.\nIt is a precious fruition of the rare wisdom and ceaseless efforts of the respected General Secretary that a new system of judging cadres, an objective and strict examination and ratification system of cadres and a system for training reserve cadres have been established in the struggle to innovate the system and method of the personnel administration in conformity with the five-point Party-building line in the new era and a foundation has been laid for ensuring objectivity, impartiality and accuracy in the whole course of the personnel administration, he stressed.\nThe report referred to the achievements made by officials in the personnel administration sector who are devoting themselves to strengthening the ranks of cadres in a qualitative way with a high sense of responsibility, firm principle and pure conscience, true to the noble intention of the General Secretary in the course of the struggle to implement the Party's policy on brining a new turn in the personal administration sector.\nMany officials who were promoted to the important posts of the Party and the government and the responsible posts of major sectors and units of socialist construction under the great trust of the Party Central Committee are playing a leading and core role in the struggle to powerfully demonstrate the dignity and prestige of our state with tireless enthusiasm and courageous capabilities, the reporter said, adding that this is a clear proof of the validity and vitality of our Party's policy on bringing about a new turn in the personal administration sector.\nThe report analyzed and reviewed a series of shortcomings and causes of failing to fulfill their responsibility and duty due to the old-fashioned viewpoint and work attitude and style of officials in the personnel administration sector, and presented the measures to overcome them.\nThen followed speeches.\nThe speeches referred to the successes and experience gained in the course of conducting the personnel administration strictly on the Party and class principles to ensure the purity and quality of the ranks of cadres, building up the ranks of cadres in a far-sighted way and selecting, distributing and educating cadres and training reserve cadres on the Party principle.\nStrictly analyzed were series of deviations revealed due to the lack of firm ideological determination that the success or failure in the revolution of personnel administration depends on the sense of responsibility and role of the officials in charge of the personnel administration sector.\nThe speakers vowed to firmly consolidate the ranks of cadres with officials fully equipped with the Party spirit, revolutionary spirit and popular spirit, and loyalists capable of assuming important sectors and posts of the Party and state, regarding the Party's policy on bringing about a new turn in the personal administration sector as their lifeline, and thus reliably guarantee the implementation of the Party's grand programme for comprehensive development of the state.\nA letter of pledge to the respected ComradeKim Jong Unwas adopted with enthusiastic applauses of the participants.\nThen a workshop was held for the participants in the conference.\nFirst, a lecture was given at the workshop to explain the main contents of the important letter sent by the General Secretary to the participants.\nThe lecturer explained in a profound way the essence of the Party's idea of prioritizing cadres and the new guidelines of personnel administration indicated by the General Secretary.\nThen, the workshop dealt with the issue of deeply grasping the undying feats performed by the General Secretary in the personnel administration sector and the principled issues to be observed in the personnel administration.\nThrough the workshop, the participants deeply studied the Party's new policies on bringing a radical turn in the personal administration sector and exchanged and shared various views of a series of issues arising in the personnel administration, thus actively cultivating the correct methodology and practical ability of the personnel administration.\nBearing deep again in mind the important mission that they have assumed personal administration decisive of the destiny of the Party and the revolution, the participants renewed their determination and readiness to realize the purity of the ranks of cadres on a high level as intended by the Party Central Committee and thus steadily write a new page in bringing a radical turn in the personal administration sector in the era of great change.\nThe First National Conference of Officials in the Personnel Administration Sector marked a significant occasion which provided another turning point in opening up a new era for bringing a radical turn in the personal administration sector for solving the cadre issue decisive of rejuvenation and prospects of the development of the state, in consolidating the ever-victorious guiding power of the Workers' Party of Korea to be an invincible one and in continuing the dynamic development and pure succession of the Juche revolution forever. -0-",

According to it, the Japanese army committed a crime of spreading typhoid germ on several occasions by the river during the retreat to pollute the area where the Red Army units were concentrated.\nThe data proving the germ warfare of Japan were disclosed by testimonies of survivors in May and August.\nJapan inflicted a miserable death upon innocent people through the development and use of biochemical weapons during the Second World War. This is a hideous crime against humanity that can never be covered up.\nThe data on the germ warfare and living-body tests of Unit 731 of the Japanese Army, which have been disclosed so far, are unprecedented in history, stunning the world people.\nFrom 1932, the murderers conducted cruel living-body tests including human anatomy, freezing experiment and germ infusion experiment on Koreans, Chinese and Russians, and thus actively served the Japanese imperialists in realizing their ambition for the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\".\nThe dark tentacles of the Japanese war criminals obsessed with revanchism were also stretched deep to the root of the barbarous germ warfare committed by the U.S. imperialists against the Korean people during the last Korean War.\nThe chemical weapons left by the secret germ warfare units of the Imperial Japanese Army such as units 731, 100, 516 and Nami 8604 after the defeat of Japan in the occupied areas still cause serious damage to the precious lives of inhabitants and the regional ecological environment.\nThat's why the international community has bitterly denounced Japan for shamelessly evading its historical, political and legal responsibility that can never be shifted onto others.\nThe damage by biochemical crimes is to be rapidly spread to all mankind, going beyond a specific country and region.\nNevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are working hard to repeat another hideous unethical crime, not content with embellishing their past crimes.\nShortly ago, they shamelessly blustered that they would discharge the nuclear-contaminated water twice additionally this year. They have already released tens of thousands of tons of nuclear-contaminated water in the Pacific from last year.\nThe descendants of the germ warfare criminals, who inflicted untold pain and misfortune upon the people in the region, are now working hard to make the whole world and mankind experimental fields and subjects for their purposes.\nThe hideous crimes against humanity which can be committed only by the barbarians under the mask of human beings are the same now as they were in the days gone.\nThe \"hideous crime-woven state\" is a proper name and pronoun of shameless Japan as an unpardonable war criminal. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) --Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, inspected the training base of the special operation units of the Korean People's Army (KPA) in the western area on October 2 to learn about the drills of combatants.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Unwas accompanied by Ri Yong Gil, chief of the KPA General Staff, Kim Yong Bok, deputy chief of the KPA General Staff, and Ri Chang Ho, deputy chief of the General Staff and director of the General Reconnaissance Bureau of the KPA.\nHe was greeted by commanding officers of the special operation units at the training base.\nAt the training base, combatants of several special operation brigades are undergoing intensive training according to the combat and political training programme.\nThat day there took place various drills of the combatants of special operation units at the base.\nThe drills were aimed at judging the combat readiness of the unit combatants and perfectly preparing them mentally, physically, tactically and technically so that they can reliably and successfully carry out their special operation tasks under any combat situation.\nThe core leading units, which have grown up to be the pivotal force of the armed forces of the DPRK absolutely and firmly defending the sovereignty of the DPRK and the happiness of its people, fully demonstrated through the training that day their might and mettle as the most elite combat units both in name and in reality, displaying the firm will and high spirit to attain their combat goals by occupying the enemy\u2019s headquarters at a stroke once the mission is given in contingency.\nWatching with satisfaction the combatants perfectly versed in different combat situations,Kim Jong Unhighly praised all of the combatants for having firmly prepared themselves politically, ideologically, militarily, technically and physically, bearing in mind the honorable mission of defending the country and its people.\nWatching the drills pulsating with the fighting spirit and heroic stamina of winning only victory in combat and annihilating the enemy without fail, he said that the DPRK gets stronger  thanks to such brave and proud soldiers who have grown up to be a-match-for-a-hundred and all-powerful fighters capable of fighting any type of war anytime with confidence and warmly encouraged their patriotic enthusiasm and militant bravery.\nHe stressed once again that the special operation forces of the KPA are now becoming the pivotal and core force in the DPRK's war deterrence and capability for fighting a war.\nUnderlining the need to making a stride forward more clearly in the development of the armed forces of the DPRK by steadily expanding and strengthening the special operation forces into the strongest combat forces, he set forth new policies related to the orientation of the building of the special operation forces.\nHe said that as he mentioned last time, it is necessary to firmly hold fast to and apply the revolution in training, ideology and equipment in the building of the special operation forces and thus more perfectly prepare them so that they take their place as the main force of war and play a decisive role in winning victory in war. He stressed the need to steadily study and apply a new methodology of Korean style in training and make combatants master it and thus create the absolute standard incomparable with any army.\nThat day he informed the commanding officers of a ceremony held by the enemies in Seoul on Oct. 1 called the \"ROK army day\".\nHe said that the puppet Yoon Suk Yeol, who had never been rid of his anti-DPRK intent, read a written commemorative address full of his lengthy counteraction will, prompted by the delusion of persecution to our Republic, and thus showed the security uneasiness and irritating psychology of the puppet forces. Through such coarse address, he made a bluff of \"resolute and overwhelming response of the ROK-U.S. alliance\" and the \"end of regime\", clamoring about the character of the ROK-U.S. alliance based on nuclear weapons, and fully betrayed the bellicose temerity,Kim Jong Unsaid, adding that they acknowledged themselves that they are the forces destroying regional security and peace and that the world would not but laugh at such poor rhetoric and visible action.\nHe said that the puppet Yoon bragged about overwhelming counteraction of military muscle at the doorstep of the state possessed of nuclear weapons and it was a great irony that caused the suspicion of being an abnormal man.\nHe said that the enemies' threatening rhetoric, action, trick and attempt did not check the DPRK's powerful military strength and will not take away our nuclear weapons forever. The DPRK has irreversibly secured the absolute strength as a nuclear power and the system and function for using it while overcoming the long-standing challenges, he noted.\nHe affirmed that \"if\" the enemy, seized with extreme foolishness and recklessness, attempt to use armed forces encroaching upon the sovereignty of the DPRK, full of excessive \"confidence\" in the ROK-U.S. alliance in disregard of our repeated warnings, the DPRK would use without hesitation all the offensive forces it has possessed, including nuclear weapons.\nSaying that to pray for a good luck of survival in a military conflict with the nuclear weapons state would be a foolish thing that should not do, he said that if such situation comes, the permanent existence of Seoul and the Republic of Korea would be impossible.\nHe stressed that this is a realistic prediction of the physical destructive power which the world people cannot but admit, not a rhetoric threat.\nWe should continue to cultivate our strength, and bear in mind again that strength in our hands is the only guarantee for keeping under control the enemy and defending ourselves, he said, adding that the KPA should firmly defend the Party, revolution, country and people by dint of its powerful military muscle, remaining more loyal to its sacred mission.\nThe tough and transparent stand and policies to fight the enemy clarified byKim Jong Undoubled the commanding officers and all the service personnel with great confidence, courage and pluck.\nKim Jong Unhad a photo session with the officers and men involved in the drills, encouraging their high ideological and mental world and the will to defend the country.\nAll the combatants of the KPA special operation units broke into cheers of hurrah, reflecting their pledge of loyalty to the great brilliant commander, who came to their training base, gave them meticulous guidance and showed deep loving care and trust for them repeatedly, and made a firm pledge to firmly prepare themselves as brave combatants capable of carrying out any militant duty most thoroughly and most perfectly at any time by continuing to strive for bolstering up the limitless capabilities for fighting war and rounding off combat preparations  as desired byKim Jong Un, bearing deep in mind the consciousness that they are the advance detachment for defending the sovereignty and interests of the state. -0-",

This is a reflection of the security uneasiness and restless psychology of the puppet forces. Through careless words, he made a bluff of a \u201cresolute and overwhelming response by the ROK-US alliance\u201d and the \u201cend of regime,\u201d clamouring about the character of the ROK-US alliance based on nukes, and fully betrayed the bellicose temerity. This means that they themselves acknowledged that they are the forces destroying regional security and peace. The world would not but laugh at such poor rhetoric and showy action.\nThe puppet Yoon bragged about overwhelming counteraction of their military muscle at the doorstep of a state possessing nuclear weapons, and it was a great irony that caused misgivings about whether he is an abnormal man.\nThe enemy\u2019s threatening rhetoric, actions, tricks and attempts have failed to check the growth of our powerful military strength and will never deprive us of our nuclear weapons. We have secured an irreversibly absolute strength as a nuclear power and the system and functions for using it by overcoming the challenges for a long time.\n\"If\" the enemy, seized with extreme foolishness and recklessness, make a step forward and attempt to use their armed forces to encroach upon the sovereignty of our Republic, full of excessive \u201cconfidence\u201d in the ROK-US alliance, in disregard of our repeated warnings, the DPRK will use without hesitation all the striking forces in its possession, including nuclear weapons.\nTo pray for a good luck of survival in a military conflict with the nuclear weapons state would be a foolish thing that should not be done. If such situation is created, the permanent existence of Seoul and the Republic of Korea would be impossible.\nThis is not a rhetorical threat, but a realistic prediction of the physical destructive power, which the world people cannot but admit.\nWe should continue to cultivate our strength and bear in mind again that the strength in our possession is the only guarantee for keeping the enemy under control and defending ourselves.\nThe KPA should firmly defend the Party, revolution, country and people by dint of its powerful military muscle, remaining more loyal to its sacred mission.\nThe hard-line and thoroughgoing stand and policies against the enemy, clarified byKim Jong Un,\u00a0redoubled the great confidence, courage and pluck of the commanding officers and all other service personnel.\nKim Jong Unhad a photo session with the officers and men, who participated in the drills, highly praising their ideological and mental world and their will to defend the country.\nAll the combatants broke into cheers of hurrah as a reflection of their pledge of loyalty to the great brilliant commander, who came to their training base, gave them meticulous guidance and bestowed loving care and trust on them repeatedly, and made a firm determination to firmly prepare themselves as brave combatants capable of carrying out any combat mission most thoroughly and perfectly at any time by continuing to strive for bolstering up the limitless capabilities for fighting war and perfecting combat preparations as desired by\u00a0him, mindful of the consciousness that they are the point men in defending the national sovereignty and interests. -0-",

This is just the same as the shameless act of the U.S. engrossed in extreme double standards and illogical way of thinking.\nIt is none other than the U.S. which is confusing right and wrong while insisting that its arms buildup and war drills involving even its mainland forces aiming at a specified state in the Korean peninsula are for \"defending freedom\" and the exercise of the right to self-defence and essential defence activities taken by the DPRK to cope with them are for \"threatening peace\".\nNATO has been spending an astronomical amount of military expenses on the offer of lethal equipment to Ukraine and openly inciting it to attacks on the Russian territory. However it is taking up a gangster-like logic that their war acts are an effort for \"preventing\" war and the establishment of normal relations between sovereign states is an act of fostering and extending war, which is just like a guilty party filing the suit first and a bad habit disseminated by the U.S.\nWe are strictly fixing our eyes on the reality in which a war monster called NATO that should have disappeared from the arena of history along with the end of the Cold War last century is stretching its black tentacles to the Korean peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region in order to provide another justification in the wake of playing a war gamble called the Ukrainian incident to find a justification for existence of itself stained with blood.\nIt is the biggest geopolitical tragedy that NATO, a product of the U.S. ambition for hegemony which is based on the gangster-like double logic and double standards and has lived on the escalation of tension and war moves, is still existent.\nThe provocative acts of NATO getting more undisguised on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region according to the U.S. illogical thinking and scenario only bring into bold relief the reason for its thorough death, not the additional justification for existence of the ill-famed war specter.\nIf NATO continues to try hard to infringe upon the dignity, sovereignty, security and interests of the DPRK while persistently pursuing hostile policy toward it, NATO blindly following the U.S. will be held wholly responsible for the tragic consequences to be entailed by it.\nThe DPRK will continue to make important efforts to defend itself from the hostile threat of the U.S. and its followers, preserve regional peace and security and build a multi-polarized world based on international justice. -0-",

General Jon Il Ho, president of the university.\nAn educator and a student of the university presented him with bouquets of fragrant flowers in humble reverence.\nHe warmly congratulated the reliable teaching staff and students who are upholding the Party's far-reaching cause of building a military power with the steadfast revolutionary spirit, matchless scientific and technological capabilities and proud academic achievements at the university, the source of the inexhaustible self-defensive military capability firmly guaranteeing the mightiness and invincibility of the state.\nHe was accompanied by Jo Chun Ryong, secretary of the WPK Central Committee, Kim Jong Sik, first deputy department director of the WPK Central Committee, Jang Chang Ha, director general of the Missile Administration of the DPRK, Ri Yong Gil, chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, Jong Kyong Thaek, director of the KPA General Political Bureau.\nKim Jong Unmade a historic speech in commemoration of his congratulatory visit to the university.\nSaying that it is a great pleasure of the WPK and the people and an auspicious event of the whole country to mark the 60th founding anniversary of the supreme academy of defence science and technology of the DPRK, which was born with the most sacred and just mission and has added brilliance to its name with the proud feats and academic achievements that it made for the country and revolution, he warmly congratulated all the lecturers, researchers, officials and students of the university on behalf of the WPK Central Committee, the government and all the armed forces of the DPRK.\nClarifying the immutable truth that the university of national defence is the most precious strategic asset for the revolutionary Party and people, he referred to the historic significance of the founding of the university which was born 60 years ago as a creation of the steadfast revolutionary will of the WPK to defend to the end the gains of the revolution won at the cost of blood by firmly holding its destiny in its own hands and the crystallization of its firm faith and ideal to provide an eternal guarantee for dignity and prosperity by building up great strength, and to its proud history and remarkable feats.\nAnalyzing the true colours and unchangeable nature of the imperialist aggressive entity which the DPRK has been confronting and its ever-more frantic provocative acts, he demonstrated the perfectness and validity of the DPRK's logic of building self-defence capability that it should have physical strength capable of always deterring the enemy and keeping the situation under control. He solemnly declared that the WPK and the government of the DPRK would never allow the balance of forces to be disrupted on the Korean peninsula, but bring about a continuous leap forward in defence science and industry and limitlessly bolster up the war deterrent for self-defence.\nUnderscoring the need to neutralize the imperialists' aggressive and adventurous military activities with absolute superiority of the Juche-oriented defence sci-tech capabilities, he set forth the basic duty the university assumes in accomplishing the important historic mission and just cause of building a new world, in which war, hegemony and injustice are not tolerated, by dint of the Juche-oriented weapons loaded with the might of revolutionary ideology and the spirit of death-defying resistance, and important tasks for fulfilling it.\nExpressing the firm will of the Party Central Committee to successfully build the university into the supreme temple where the revolutionary talents and world-famous inventors representing the future of the DPRK's munitions industry and defence science are continually trained and into a prestigious and renowned defence science research centre, so as to guarantee the eternal well-being and prosperity of the country, he expressed belief that all the lecturers, researchers, students and graduates of the university would demonstrate forever the supremacy of the revolutionary industry with the fruition of noble revolutionary spirit and educational development and excellent academic successes and powerful entities, mindful of the expectations of the Party, country and people.\nWhen he finished his speech, the participants responded with cheers of single-hearted loyalty as they looked up to the great teacher who clarified the great strategy of struggle for firmly defending and glorifying forever the ever-victorious prestige and honour of our state gained with the great revolutionary ideology and indomitable spirit and through the costly struggle and has guided the defence scientists in the drive to break through the cutting edge for boosting the defence capabilities.\nHe extended militant greetings to the teaching staff, students and graduates who were filled with the burning enthusiasm to absolutely guarantee the implementation of the Party\u2019s policy on defence science with death-defying patriotic devotion, steady exertions and remarkable educational and scientific achievements by redoubling the absolute sense of mission they have assumed before the Party, revolution, country and people.\nHe went round the room for education in the revolutionary history and the room dedicated to the history of the university.\nHe recalled with deep emotion the immortal exploits of PresidentKim Il Sungand ChairmanKim Jong Ilwho declared the establishment of the centre for training talents in defence science and technology for the eternal dignity and might of the Korean revolution in the first half of the 1960s when the historic advance for the simultaneous promotion of economic construction and defence buildup, the embodiment of the WPK's idea of defending the country by national efforts, started and who developed it into a national defence university with worldwide prestige and reputation.\nSaying that the proud history of the university, which has produced more than 180 DPRK heroes and labour heroes and dozens of winners of the highest orders in the past 60 years, is the epitome of the brilliant feats it performed as it played a core and pivotal role in accomplishing the historic cause of increasing national self-defence capabilities, he noted that the legendary reputation of the university, which has paved the way for the victorious advance of the country with loyalty to the Party and the revolution and great ability, should flutter as a banner in the vanguard of the struggle for securing the greatest military technological capability in the world.\nThe present world in which the destiny of a country and nation is decided by the national defence capability clearly proves that there is a sure guarantee for the existence of a state and its prosperity in systematically training a large contingent of talented personnel in the field of defence science and technology who have made the validity of their cause and ardent patriotism part of their mental qualities, he said, urging the university to train more revolutionary talents representing the future of the munitions industry and defence science, directly related to the future destiny of the country and revolution, and thus fulfill the important mission it has assumed before the times.\nHe repeatedly stressed the steadfast will of the Party to develop the university into the best one with the highest ability in the country and the most prestigious research-type one in the world where the integration of education, scientific research and production has been realized on the highest level, and took a benevolent measure to successfully spruce up its educational conditions and environment in a comprehensive way as required by the new era.\nHe met the meritorious officials, scientists and technicians in the field of national defence industry, who visited their alma mater on the occasion of its diamond jubilee, and had a picture taken with them.\nThen he had a photo session with the teaching staff and students of the university greeting its 60th founding anniversary, which will be eternally recorded in the history.\nAll the teaching staff, students and graduates extended their gratitude to the benevolent father who visited the university to illuminate the path of a new revolution in the defence education with his original ideological and theoretical wisdom and extraordinary scientific insight and to show them warm love.\nAll the teaching staff and students raised stormy cheers out of loyalty and resolution while warmly seeing offKim Jong Unwho was leaving the university after showing love and trust to be handed down through generations.\nThe noble trace left by the respected ComradeKim Jong Unin the pedigree institution for training talents in defence science and technology will shine forever in history as a significant occasion which injected great vitality into the implementation of the WPK's far-reaching strategy for further consolidating and glorifying the irreversible position of the DPRK, which has emerged as the world\u2019s military power, and as an important milestone in the revolution in national defence education. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, October 8 (KCNA) -- The respected ComradeKim Jong Unmade a speech at the congratulatory visit toKim Jong UnUniversity of National Defence.\nThe full text of the speech is as follows:\nComrades,\nThis defence university, which was established with the most sacred and righteous mission and has glorified its name with unexcelled merits and proud academic records for the country and the revolution, is greeting its meaningful 60th founding anniversary.\nCelebration of this anniversary of the school, an institute for training steadfast and capable personnel in defending the Party and the revolution by force of arms and the highest defence sci-tech institute in our Republic that reliably supports the historic cause of building a prosperous country with a strong army, is a source of great delight for our Party and people and an auspicious event for the whole country.\nOn behalf of the Party Central Committee, our government and the whole armed forces of the Republic, I extend warm congratulations to all the teachers, researchers, officials and students of the university standing here with the most dignified and proud feeling of building up the defence industry of lasting significance, which represents the strength of our country, Korea, and its ever-victorious glory.\nMy warm greetings also go to the family members, who are making painstaking efforts to care for the educators in adding to the weight and prestige of this sacred university, and to those who have sent their beloved sons and daughters willingly to the forefront of defending the country and the revolution.\nComrades,\nIf someone asks our Party and people waging the revolution what is their most valuable strategic asset, they will say that is this defence university, a \u201cpedigree farm\u201d for training defence sci-tech talents.\nAnd if he asks what are the most precious resources that can guarantee the future of a powerful country, they will also say they are the revolutionary talented personnel studying at this university.\nThe university has proved this iron truth of history with its dignified history and wonderful feats.\nAs I am standing here on this meaningful day, I am reminded of how epochal and decisive the day of 60 years ago was in achieving the success of our revolutionary cause and carving out the destiny of our state.\nThe founding of this university was not simply something created by the fateful decade, when confrontation between socialism and imperialism and between revolution and counterrevolution was acute on the globe and when the urgency of building self-reliant defences in every country posed itself not in words but by shocking events and as a stark reality.\nIt was an institute born of the steadfast revolutionary will of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea to take its destiny firmly in its own hands and defend to the last the gains of the revolution achieved at the cost of blood; it was also a crystallization of its firm faith and ideals for setting up a notable landmark in achieving dignity and prosperity by building great strength.\nIt would not be so hard to imagine how extraordinary and audacious the decision was to found this university amid the then global political landscape and internal and external situations of our country.\nIf the great leader ComradeKim Il Sunghad lived to continue to write his reminiscences without stopping it to our painful memory, he would have recollected why this university had to be founded, I believe.\nAs it was founded from scratch with the spirit of self-respect and self-reliance as its lifeblood, since the first day of its founding the university, with Juche as its lifeline and characteristic feature, has served as a reliable base for implementing the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea\u2019s line of self-reliant defence and added inexhaustible potential and dynamism to the growth and development of the defence capability of our state.\nThe Juche orientation and modern character are two attributes and buttresses of our self-reliant national defence, and these can be defended and built up only when it has a base for training its own sci-tech talents.\nIn fact, from the day of this university\u2019s founding our defence industry could set a clear goal and orientation for its development as a Juche-oriented industry that develops and produces our own style of weapons and other combat equipment, and make rapid development as an industry possessed of self-supporting, modern and advanced characters.\nThough it made its start literally from scratch\u2013without the foundations of the machine-building industry and an asset of munitions industry\u2013our defence industry laid already in the 1970s its firm production foundations based on modern defence science and technology, and has since supported the Party\u2019s cause on the strength of Juche-oriented science and industry. The annals of its great history have been written together with those of the history of this university\u2019s development.\nThis is the very place where large contingents of competent personnel have grown up equipping themselves with the spirit of Juche and up-to-date military science and made tangible contributions to the victorious revolution by satisfactorily raising our country\u2019s defence capabilities to the level as high as is required by the revolution at each period and stage of its development. The fine people trained in this campus now constitute the backbone of the revolutionary industry in writing, together with our Party, a new chapter of history of strength the world has never known.\nOur own style of weaponry has attained the power which nobody else on this planet could copy, the powerful strength by which the embryo of great historic events is developing. This strength is undoubtedly the might of potentialities of the Juche-oriented science, crystallization of the pride of Korea and the resourcefulness of the Korean people, and of our proud defence scientists who are the incarnation of those qualities.\nThe university has untiringly injected the two essential attributes of vitality, that is, the Juche orientation and modern character, into the revolutionary industry that shoulders the destiny and future of the Party, the state and the people, and laid solid and stable foundations for our country to rise as a world-class power. Herein lies the historic importance of the founding of the university and the incomparable glory of its 60-year history.\nWe know there are long-standing institutes around the world boasting their time-honoured traditions of defence science education and training of capable personnel; yet none of them could be a match for this university, a revolutionary institute, which, based in the capital city of the revolution, has maintained its lineage of absolute loyalty to the Party Central Committee and its lines while firmly supporting the revolutionary cause without a slightest vacillation or hesitation for 60 years for its steadfast inheritance and accomplishment.\nThis honourable history and traditions of the university and the names and exploits of the numerous heroes born of the university are rather little-known, but the imprints of their life are left anywhere in our country, and their soul of national defence is reflected in the hatred-charged powerful weapons that strike terror into the enemy.\nAvailing myself of this opportunity, I would like to highly appreciate the teachers and researchers of the university for the ennobling careers they have made and the patriotic feats they have performed while living a wartime-like life even in peacetime on their uninterrupted march of service for the country and their fellow people, mindful of the heavy class mission charged by the Party and the revolution to them.\nAlso, I hope from the bottom of my heart that the students will grow as reliable successors to the cornerstone of our Republic.\nComrades,\nThe defence university does not simply represent the glorious past and present of the revolutionary industry which is a strong buttress of our independent, powerful and self-sustaining country; it also serves as a bulwark of strategic importance for achieving one victory after another in the years to come.\nYour campus is a fierce battlefield, not a comfortable place.\nThe enemy you are facing are die-hard anti-communists, who would not change their hostile consciousness against our Republic until their doomsday. And they are imperialist aggressive forces that boast their highly advanced military science and technology and munitions industry plus their centuries-old belligerency.\nIt is a matter of course that the more fearfully they become aware of their doomsday coming closer, the more frantic the ringleader of aggression and its lackeys, dependent on anti-communism and war for their existence, will go and rush to war till they collapse with sheer exhaustion.\nThis is evident when we consider what happened on October 1 last, when the rulers of the Republic of Korea, holding a pompous ceremony to mark what they called the \u201cROK Army Day,\u201d glibly read ignoble and disgraceful lines only to reveal their abnormal way of thinking to the outside world.\nThe puppet regime, attaching special importance to the inauguration of the \u201cstrategic command\u201d which they had pushed ahead with as the \u201ccore project of the state administration,\u201d claimed that their \u201clatest conventional combat capability has finally merged with the extended deterrent capability of the U.S.\u201d\nObviously they do not have any strategic weapons worth mentioning, but they have made up the \u201cstrategic command\u201d\u2013without real worth\u2013by borrowing their master\u2019s nukes, and praised it as \u201ccore unit\u201d and \u201cgreat build-up of the defence capabilities.\u201d They went so far as to give a long and nice narration of how a latest strategic nuclear submarine of the U.S. entered the ROK for the first time in some 40 years, followed by the landing of a strategic bomber for the first time in history. This is a frank and self-praising admission of the record of their intentional and planned worsening of the regional situation in cooperation with their master.\nThe \u201ccongratulatory speech\u201d is simply a presentation of desperate bluff that comes from their inferiority complex in strength and their morbid consciousness of persecution by our state. In a nutshell, it reveals only their absurd intention to maintain at any cost the balance of strength with us by relying on the ROK-U.S. alliance that has mutated into a nuke-based military bloc.\nI am saying this as you need to have a clear understanding of our enemy.\nIn delivering the \u201ccongratulatory speech\u201d Yoon Suk Yeol intentionally made mean and vulgar remarks about ending the government of our Republic. This indicates that he is totally gripped by a blind belief in his master\u2019s \u201cmight.\u201d\nAs you have learned through newspapers and broadcasts, some days ago I made clear my view of and stand towards this matter.\nA wise statesman would not act so rashly as to endanger the security of his country and its population; in dealing with a nuclear-armed rival, rather than opt for a confrontation or face-off with it, he would put emphasis on, and concern himself about, how to handle the situation and avoid military conflict.\nIt is because this option is absolutely right and helpful to ensure the security of his country.\nDoing so is just what a veteran statesman would choose to do, an expression of his political proficiency and finesse.\nThen what did the man say in Seoul?\nSpeaking on the doorstep of a nuclear-armed state, he clamoured about responding with overwhelming military strength. How would this be commented on by the audiences the world over?\nWould he be praised for having been born with rare courage? Or would he be described as a patriotic commander or the like?\nEven if there appeared a matchless commander unheard-of in the time-honoured history, he would not be able to come up with a realistic method of overcoming the distinctions between the capabilities of nukes and conventional weapons.\nThis is the very reason that I called him one who is most likely to be considered a man lacking something.\nFor the Republic of Korea, all that it needs to do in order to guarantee its security is not provoking us into using our military strength.\nThis is so simple a method.\nIt would find itself safe if it refrained from provoking us or flexing its muscles before us at times, but it seems that Seoul has no one capable of doing such a simple thing.\nTo be honest, we have no intention of attacking the Republic of Korea.\nThinking of it is abominable, and we hate dealing with those in it.\nFormerly, we often spoke about liberating the south and reunification by force of arms, but now we are not interested in it. And since our statement about two separate states, we have been all the more unwilling to be conscious of the state in the south.\nHowever, the point is that the latter provokes us now and then.\nWe must keep close watch on the recent developments around our country.\nDeeply engrossed in their preposterous schemes to \u201ccontain\u201d the non-existent threat against them, the U.S. imperialists and their puppets have converted the ROK-U.S. alliance into a nuclear-based one, and they are growing frantic in their arms build-up. Their desperate clamour for war and provocations threaten to disrupt the balance of strength on the Korean peninsula at any moment.\nTheir expansion of armaments and military actions are justifiable and self-defensive, whereas our responses are threats and provocations\u2013this is the U.S. imperialists\u2019 and their stooges\u2019 way of thinking, an illogical and perverted approach that is tantamount to that of the thief crying \u201cStop thief!\u201d\nIn other words, it is a robber\u2019s logic, namely the problem is not what is being done, but who is doing it.\nWe do not recognize it, and such far-fetched sophism of the enemy can never check our strength from growing.\nThe disturbed balance of strategic strength on the Korean peninsula precisely means the outbreak of war.\nTherefore, the logic on the self-reliant defence building, the logic that we should possess physical strength with which to always contain the enemy and control the situation is absolutely open and above board.\nOur progress towards a military superpower, a nuclear power, will grow faster.\nNow that the ROK-U.S. military alliance has completely changed into a nuclear alliance as the puppets advertise themselves, the preparedness of our state for nuclear counteractions should be further perfected on the high level defying limits.\nBy the way, I would like to mention that on October 4 a spokesman for the UN secretary general asked us to lower the rhetoric.\nI am not sure that such a request was also conveyed to Seoul, but I would take this opportunity to stress once again that the international community should have a proper understanding of my remarks.\nI have clearly and consistently put a precondition of the word \u201cif\u201d whenever I clarified our stand on the use of military strength.\nUnder the precondition of \u201cif,\u201d our Constitution will issue a strict order to our armed forces.\nIf the enemy attempt to have recourse to arms against our state, the armed forces of our Republic will use all the strike capabilities without hesitation.\nThey will not rule out the use of nuclear weapons.\nI stress once again: Pinning hopes for survival in such a situation is useless and no fortune or alleged guardianship of God can protect the ROK.\nThis is not an issue related to rhetoric as mentioned by the UN, but it is exactly a warning of action.\nConfronting us are the largest nuclear power in the world and the most vicious of its puppets attempting to fool with its nukes.\nUnder such circumstances our view, option and resolve can never be changed.\nThe enemy should refrain from acting rashly.\nThey should never slight our warning that if they misunderstand it as something like their worn-out, half-baked bluff, they would pay more dearly for it.\nThe absolute strength we have possessed at present is discharging in a responsible manner the mission of deterring a war and defending peace.\nNo forces will dare opt for the use of military strength against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, a military conflict.\nHowever, the more desperately the enemy try to hold supremacy by dint of the \u201cnuclear alliance\u201d and reverse the strategic situation, the more steadily we should make a leap forward in defence science and industry and the more firmly we should consolidate our war deterrent for self-defence.\nOur Party and the government of our Republic will never tolerate the balance of strength being disturbed on the Korean peninsula.\nWe should neutralize the imperialists\u2019 adventurist military acts of aggressive nature by dint of the absolute superiority of the strength of the Juche-oriented defence science and technology.\nNothing will overwhelm the strength of the Juche-type weapons loaded with the might of the revolutionary ideas and the do-or-die resistance spirit, and we, based on this strength, should create a new world, in which war, hegemony and injustice shall not be allowed.\nThis defence university should continue to make responsible and devoted efforts until we accomplish this important mission and righteous cause entrusted to us by the times and history.\nThe basic task facing the university is to train in larger numbers pillars who would further consolidate and glorify the position of our Republic as a world-class military superpower, competent talents who are possessed of the Juche-oriented ideology and theory on defence science, a wealth of specialist knowledge and practical abilities, and the key to this end is to radically improve the level of its education.\nTo improve the level of its education is the absolute demand of our Party and revolution, and the university should take the lead in implementing the Party\u2019s policy on bringing about a radical turn in education.\nTrue to the essence of our Party\u2019s defence policy on guaranteeing the security of the country and people by our own efforts and in accordance with the characteristics of education in defence science and technology and the global trend of the development of military hardware, the university should formulate its educational programme correctly, reorganize the overall structure of its education and make positive efforts to study and apply advanced teaching methods with the main stress on putting the contents of education on a scientific, practical, comprehensive and modern footing, thus increasing the ranks of talents capable of confidently leading the steady advance and development of our defence industry.\nIt should thoroughly establish the Juche orientation in the education of defence science and technology so as to play a decisive role in rooting out dogmatic, stereotyped and imitative practices that remain in the defence industry, and pay special attention to intensifying basic science education as suited to its characteristics.\nIn order for the university to keep up its appearance as befits its position and weight, it should, above all else, improve the quality of the ranks of its teachers and ensure that all of them possess high intellect combined with the qualifications of educators.\nWith a clear view and stand that improved qualifications are inconceivable separate from scientific research, the teachers and researchers should be proactive in participating in developing cutting-edge military hardware urgently needed in strengthening the country\u2019s defence capabilities and perfecting the combat preparedness of the People\u2019s Army, as well as in projects to push back the frontiers of defence science and technology. In this way, they can prepare themselves to be talented educationists, who possess as their essential qualifications rich experience in education and latest science and technology so as to create a climate of talented persons training students to be more talented ones.\nThe university Party committee should make strenuous efforts to establish more firmly the unified leadership system of the Party and a climate of strictly observing order, keeping secrets and maintaining moral discipline in the campus and lay firm material foundations of the university. In this way, it can constantly improve the working and living conditions for the teachers, researchers and students, who are invaluable for our Party.\nThe Party and the state should give active support to the defence university in its work and throw their weight behind it.\nRelevant departments of the Party Central Committee should pay close attention to the university\u2019s work and give proper Party-oriented guidance to the university. Other relevant sectors and units should take measures for solving on a priority basis the problems arising in the management and operation of the university.\nIt is the determination of the Party Central Committee to radically transform the appearance and educational environment of the university with the goal of turning it into one of the most prestigious universities in the world at an earlier date.\nThe university should be furnished with the latest educational apparatuses and equipment and IT means so that other universities dare not compare themselves with it in terms of the level of modernization.\n\u2026\nThe validity and superiority of our Party\u2019s defence policy and the Korean-style education policy and our state\u2019s scientific and technological force and its level of remarkable development should be represented by the prestige and reputation of this university, and the honour of renowned red scientists creating new things from nothing if they are needed for our revolution should belong to its graduates.\nDefence university students who will carry through the revolution following our Party,\nAll of you, wearing the military uniform of the revolution in your precious university days and spending these days filled with a sense of uncommon mission and patriotic enthusiasm, should keep in mind that your academic records reflect your revolutionary faith, patriotism and loyalty and be ardent in studying and earnest in thinking, thus preparing yourselves to be pillars who will shoulder the future of the Juche-oriented defence science and munitions industry.\nYou should always bear in mind that as students of the defence university, you should be called exemplary young students of Korea, who cherish loyalty to your country and revolution as your lifeblood, are well-versed in the latest scientific and technological advances in your major fields, and are possessed of creative abilities.\nTo develop the defence university into the highest institute responsible for producing without interruption talented revolutionary personnel and world-renowned inventors that are representative of the future of our munitions industry and defence science, and into an authoritative and prestigious defence science research centre, in order to ensure the eternal security and prosperity of our country\u2013this is the Party Central Committee\u2019s firm determination and will.\nFully convinced that all the teachers, researchers, students and graduates of the university, mindful of the expectations of their Party, country and fellow people, will continue to demonstrate the excellence of the revolutionary industry by displaying their ennobling revolutionary spirit, achieving substantial progress in education, making high academic achievements and developing powerful weapons, I once again extend warm congratulations and offer my heartfelt tribute to our Party\u2019s faithful revolutionary soldiers and true patriots on the occasion of their holiday. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, October 11 (KCNA) -- The respected ComradeKim Jong Ungave the following discourse titled \"Officials should become communist revolutionaries who are possessed of the Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit as their mental qualities\" to Rodong Sinmun, organ of the Central Committee of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea on October 10, Juche 113 (2024):\nToday, when we are making a vigorous advance to confidently open a new golden age of strengthening the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and an era of achieving the comprehensive rejuvenation of the state, we are greeting the 79th founding anniversary of the WPK, the great guide of the Juche revolution.\nThe more closely we look back upon the protracted and glorious road of struggle it has followed, the more proud we feel of the greatness of our Party that has written the longest ruling history of socialism together with the Korean revolution, the Korean people and this country and the more precious we feel the unprecedented history of its founding and exploits pioneered and achieved by the forerunners in the revolution.\nGreeting the meaningful anniversary of Party founding, I pay the immortal glory and noble tribute to the revolutionaries of the first generation of the WPK, who wonderfully achieved the historic cause of giving birth to the militant General Staff of the revolution in the arduous and complicated struggle.\nI also extend warm greetings to the members of the WPK and all other people across the country, who are working with devotion to implement the struggle programme of the Party, supporting it single-heartedly with absolute trust in it and unshakable belief in the victory of the revolution even in the face of all manner of trials and difficulties.\nIt is very meaningful that today we are reconfirming the justness of the line of building up the Party in the new era, which it is applying, and hardening our revolutionary faith and will to remain loyal to its cause while looking back upon what its original features were on the historic day when the cause of its building was achieved, how it was founded and how its glorious and victorious history started.\nNext year we will be greeting the 80th anniversary of Party founding.\nA revolutionary party with the longest ruling history\u2013this is not a simple rhetorical expression.\nThe epochal significance of the day when the birth of the vanguard of the Korean revolution was declared to the world is more conspicuous not simply because thanks to this day our Party could set the longest record in the history of the ruling socialist parties.\nIt is all the more so because securely preserving the purity of all the precious assets and traditions created in the pioneering period of the revolution poses itself as an important problem decisive of its future development as the revolution advances, and because today we are realizing its importance to the utmost extent.\nThe sacred ruling history of the WPK spanning nearly 80 years and the great exploits it has performed in these decades for the country, people, times and revolution originate in the characteristic and profound ideals and spirit it adopted at the time of its founding and the steadfast inheritance of them.\nIn the long period since the day of its grand start to this day, it has led the socialist cause victoriously, firmly maintaining its revolutionary character and original features unique in the world without the slightest deviation or discolouring and enjoying the absolute support and trust of the masses of the people. This is because it has remained faithful to its original ideals and spirit and steadily carried them forward from one generation into the next.\nThe factor most decisive of the existence and development of a political party is on what ideals and spirit it was founded and how they have been inherited in their pure form.\nAs a problem that is related with a party\u2019s historical origin and character and the lineage that ensures its existence from one generation into the next, it is of absolute importance in its building and activities.\nThe original ideals and spirit of the WPK, unprecedented in the history of political parties of the working class, contain a precious iron truth, which was found in the course of pioneering a fresh road of building a revolutionary party and whose everlasting veracity has been verified on the arduous road of consolidating the organizational and ideological foundations to this end.\nThese great spiritual assets have served as a dynamic force that has enabled the WPK to follow the road resplendent with victory while preserving its character and bloodline and steadily improving its ruling and guiding abilities as a revolutionary party of a Juche type that struggles, guided solely by its leader\u2019s revolutionary ideology, to build a communist society where the people\u2019s ideals are fully realized.\nAs it had laid its spiritual foundations solid enough to guarantee its eternal viability already before it was born, the WPK has been able to adorn its entire course of arduous and complicated struggle with victories and successes.\nBut for the spiritual assets bequeathed by the generation of pioneers of the cause of Party founding, it would not have been able to found itself as a mass-based party of the working people in such a short period of time immediately after liberation in defiance of different political parties and groupings advocating isms and assertions of all hues; nor would it have been able to achieve the cause of founding the army and the state and then repulse the armed invasion by the allied imperialist forces\u2013which was a world-startling miracle\u2013thus demonstrating the honour and glory of the new-born Korea.\nWhen the other ruling socialist parties were being swept into the vortex of revisionism and dogmatism resulting in the political upheaval of capitalist revival in a number of countries, it marched forward unflinchingly under the banner of its socialist and communist programme. Its profile is shining as the symbol of a revolutionary party.\nEtched in the chronicles of the working-class party building are tragic records of not a few of them, though having been born as the revolutionary vanguard in championing the demands and interests of the working people, giving up their original fighting programmes and the revolutionary spirit of their founder generation, going degenerated in the face of countless challenges and counter-revolutionary offensives, and meeting the end of their existence.\nPursuing reformism by a party in its building on the pretext of the changes in the times will inevitably lead to the deviation from its original ideals and degradation in ideology and spirit, which will in turn weaken its ruling efficiency.\nTransformation and innovation is a law-governed demand in party building and an essential precondition for its political leadership over the revolution and construction.\nYet, a revolutionary party should never permit any transformation or reform of the ideals and spirit it adopted at the time of its founding.\nThis is because the ideals and spirit comprehensively represent not only the party\u2019s guiding ideology and fighting programme and good experience in its founding, but also the principles and ethos it has to adhere to throughout the course of its building.\nThe true value of a party\u2019s original ideals and spirit lies not simply in that they served as a powerful engine leading the cause it adopted at its inception, but also in that they offer a sure guarantee for its greater leadership ability and brighter future with an inexhaustible viability even after its founding.\nMindful of the noble sense of responsibility and mission it assumed for the destiny of the country and the people, our Party has been consistent in holding fast to and carrying forward its original ideals and spirit even in the face of manifold, unprecedented and complicated trials. This has enabled it to write its long ruling history as the one of steadfast development and laudable guidance, the great one of devoted service for the people.\nNo other party in the world is longer-standing and better-prepared than ours in terms of ruling years, leadership authority, ideology, theory, work methods and discipline.\nThe absolute dignity and greatness unique to our Party precisely represents the ennobling and great qualities of its original ideals and spirit; the inexhaustible viability of our Party comes precisely from that of its original ideals and spirit.\nOur Republic has made great leaps forward while pressing on against unheard-of difficulties and developed into a matchless power which no other forces dare defy. Witnessing its sacred and dignified image, our people are realizing anew the value of the great ideals and spirit.\nWhen the banner a party raised at its inception is great and when its succession is great, the party\u2019s past, present and future will all be adorned with victory and glory-this is a truth etched in the history of the WPK spanning nearly 80 years.\nThis great iron truth verified by history will remain valid for all eternity.\nWe should maintain the purity of our Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit that determine its revolutionary character and mode of existence and apply them to its building and activities to the letter. This is the way to ensure its eternal development as a dignified and powerful party through all ages.\nThose who should stand in the vanguard of our Party that is winning victory after victory on the strength of its great original ideals and spirit are officials most faithful to it.\nDespite the change of generations along with the advance of the revolution, our officials, the backbone of our Party, should be communist revolutionaries who are thoroughly equipped with its original ideals and spirit. By doing so we can implement the five-point line of Party building in the new era and thus improve the profile and militant efficiency of our Party in every way possible.\nProceeding from this, our Party, at the historic watershed of its development, put up the slogan \"Let Us Open a Great Golden Age of Party Building in the New Era by Carrying Forward Its Original Ideals and Spirit!\" and set it as the primary revolutionary task of officials to carry forward on a higher level the ideals, faith, spirit and temperament cherished by the first-generation revolutionaries in accomplishing the cause of Party founding.\nThe original ideals and spirit of the Party should be adopted by Juche-type communist revolutionaries as the essence of their ideological and mental qualities.\nLoyalty to the leader, devotion to the revolutionary cause, the spirit of serving the people, high-level class consciousness, socialist patriotism and ennobling moral traits\u2013these constitute the major ideological and spiritual qualities of a communist revolutionary of a Juche type, the perfect incarnations of which were the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters.\nWhen they had no government to provide a rear, these fighters pioneered the revolution barehanded and waged it while eating and sleeping in the blizzard-swept wilderness. In doing so, they trusted the great leader ComradeKim Il Sungand nobody else, and their 20-year-long, immortal chronicles of resistance and the sacred history of Party founding were written with their beautiful ideals of socialism and communism, steadfast faith in the revolution and indomitable fighting spirit.\nHaving performed imperishable exploits for Party founding and the sacred cause of building the country and its armed forces, the revolutionary forerunners remained honest and resolute all their lives and worked with devotion for the prosperity of the country and the wellbeing of their fellow people.\nMany years have passed, but the noble soul cherished by these first-generation revolutionaries has served as an inexhaustible source of sustenance to bring up the people of the later generations into true fighters and communists.\nTo embody and apply the Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit to the letter poses itself today as a most pressing, crucial task facing our officials as leading personnel of the revolution.\nOur Party is making sustained efforts to build up the country\u2019s defence capability to cope with the allied imperialist forces\u2019 moves for aggression and war, and at the same time is conducting gigantic projects for the comprehensive development of socialism.\nThe tasks facing us are challenging, yet we are short of qualified officials who are equal to such tasks.\nThe first-generation revolutionaries who created the Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit passed away, and the faithful, veteran officials of the second generation who had been trained under their direct concern and influence, are passing away one after another. In order to ensure that the officials of the new generation fill the forerunners\u2019 positions and roles with credit, we should make constant efforts to transform cadres along revolutionary lines and adopt radical measures to improve their training.\nThis is the very reason why the Party Central Committee puts the main emphasis on improving personnel administration, underlining the need for our cadres to live and work like the forerunners who blazed a trail for the cause of Party founding. These years, while giving top priority to the work of the Central Cadres Training School of the WPK, it has invested a huge sum in developing it into a political school without parallel in the world, the best \u201cpedigree farm\u201d for training Party cadres.\nThe ruling history of our Party spans nearly eight decades, and its policy of making officials revolutionary and working-class dates back far more than half a century. Never before have we brought the Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit to the fore as the banner for transforming cadres along revolutionary lines.\nOnly when we equip our cadres with the far-reaching ideals, steadfast revolutionary faith and indomitable spirit that have been etched in the great history of Party founding, can we successfully attain the goal of transforming our Party\u2019s cadres along revolutionary lines and bring about a great turn in building up the Party.\nThe Party\u2019s original ideals should be a purpose of life and work for our cadres and part of their creed, and the Party\u2019s original spirit and ethos should definitely dominate their thinking and action. Only then will the ranks of our Party\u2019s cadres become steel-strong with genuine communist revolutionaries, adding inexhaustible dynamism to our cause of building up the Party to make a steady advance along the road of victory.\nAll our officials should work hard to temper themselves in the flames of transforming cadres along revolutionary lines, fully conscious of the urgent practical requirements and the important mission they have assumed for the times\u2013writing a new, great chapter of history of the WPK by carrying forward its original ideals and spirit.\nThat officials possess the Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit as their mental qualities means that they cherish the first-generation revolutionaries\u2019 boundless loyalty to the Party and the revolution and their spirit of devoted service to the people, as their essential temperament and principle of life, always thinking and acting accordingly.\nLoyalty to the Party, the revolution and the people, as was displayed by this generation, is the three-point essential temperament to be possessed of by our officials who are the leading personnel of the revolution and the hard core of our Party.\nOfficials should have a high degree of loyalty to the Party and fulfil their responsibility and duty as its core members in supporting its ideology and leadership.\nThey should take the lead, first and foremost, in defending our Party\u2019s dignity and authority in every possible way.\nOur Party\u2019s dignity represents our state\u2019s prestige, and it is a source of the greatest pride and honour for our people.\nOur forerunners of the preceding generations, despite the difficulty and complexity of their struggle, were unconditional in safeguarding the Party\u2019s dignity and authority and defending the revolution. We must never allow their ennobling spirit and merited contributions to remain merely as memories of the past.\nIn the struggle of the present times, too, our officials should regard it as the starting point and fundamental principle of their thinking and activities to thoroughly defend the prestige of the Party.\nThey should make it their habit to always try to identify any shortcomings in ensuring the absolute authority of the Party in all processes and on all occasions of their work and life and take steps to prevent any minor defects.\nThey should consider all affairs carefully and organize and carry them out scrupulously while giving top priority to ensuring the authority of the Party rather than attempting to achieve immediately visible successes.\nTheir loyalty to the Party is manifested intensively in implementing its lines, policies and decisions to the letter.\nThe environment and conditions in the early days after the Party was founded were worse than those of today and the cadres\u2019 academic attainments or career were not conspicuous, but their viewpoint of and attitude to the Party\u2019s lines and policies and their political awareness and sensibility were on a remarkably high level, which our officials should attain today.\nOfficials should learn from the spiritual world of the first-generation revolutionaries, and become staunch fighters who are perfect in implementing the Party\u2019s policies even in the face of manifold trials and difficulties.\nAt present some officials, unaware of the quintessence of our Party\u2019s policies, are working subjectively and merely to satisfy their own taste and, claiming that they are implementing the Party\u2019s policies, they are vulgarizing these policies and even distorting their execution, deviated from Party principle. These are serious mistakes.\nWhatever they do, officials should have a clear understanding of the Party\u2019s intention, and, on its basis, consistently maintain the methodology of planning their work and finding solutions to the problems; and they should direct the greatest efforts to carrying out the Party\u2019s decisions perfectly without any slightest compromise or deviation.\nThey should fully display their Party spirit in the struggle for strengthening the politico-ideological unity of the Party and the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks.\nWe should never rest on our laurels or relax as the unity and cohesion of the Party and the revolutionary ranks have been firmly maintained up to now, nor forget even a moment that the enemy within and without are waiting for a chance to undermine the single-hearted unity and resorting to more desperate schemes.\nWith an awareness that they stand on the forefront of defending the unity and cohesion of the Party, officials should firmly preserve the politico-ideological purity of the revolutionary ranks by launching a principled, merciless struggle against those who have been deteriorated ideologically and degenerated in their class consciousness.\nThey should think and act thoroughly in line with the unified leadership system of the Party Central Committee, launch a struggle immediately against any trifling negative tendencies and elements such as idolizing individuals, regarding oneself as exceptional and working in a self-centred way and stamp them out resolutely.\nI have already said that our officials should coordinate the public sentiments as carefully as running with an electric bulb on a glass tray. This means that it is quite a difficult task to manage the public sentiments and maintain unity, and great efforts should be directed to this task with constant care and attention.\nOfficials should thoroughly orient and subordinate all their work to strengthening the single-hearted unity between the Party and the masses and deal with the arising problems in accordance with Party and class principles after correctly distinguishing whether they are favourable or not to cementing the single-hearted unity.\nOur officials should make devoted efforts with thoroughgoing revolutionary spirit.\nOur Party set it as the development strategy of our own style to develop all sectors of socialist construction, all regions of the country and all fields of the national economy in a balanced, simultaneous way, and made such a challenging strategic decision as shouldering the task for a mid-term and long-term rural rejuvenation and regional development while carrying out the gigantic struggle tasks of the five-year plan set forth at its Eighth Congress.\nIt is a clear expression of our Party\u2019s revolutionary stand to live up at any cost to the responsibility entrusted by the times and the revolution as well as to the people\u2019s trust and expectation, and this requires all our officials to make unyielding and devoted efforts with renewed revolutionary conviction and fighting spirit.\nAs shown by the life of the many loyal persons who have stoutly supported the Party\u2019s cause from the early days of its founding up to the present, a fighter who overcomes hardships by means of conviction and optimism and devotes his all to the sacred cause for the country and the people can be said to be a genuine revolutionary.\nA man with no conviction and optimism can neither feel the worth of waging the revolution nor tide over the hardships, easily wavering in the face of difficulties and trials.\nWith clear insight into the present reality that convincingly shows the absolute superiority of the socialism of our own style and promises a bright future for the overall rejuvenation of our state, officials should brave all manner of challenges and trials in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and carry out the decisions of the Party Congress and the plenary and political bureau meetings of the Party Central Committee.\nIt is most pressing for them to retain a strong sense of responsibility and display infinite devotion in implementing their official duties.\nLoyalty to the revolution means a keen awareness of responsibility for one\u2019s revolutionary duty and indomitable exertion.\nThe present era, in which the campaign for gigantic creation unprecedented in the history of our socialist construction is underway, demands hands-on officials who achieve remarkable results with a high sense of responsibility, bold drive, stubborn fighting spirit and persistent executive ability.\nHowever, our officials have yet to rid themselves of such irresponsible and insincere tendencies as formalism, expediency, and self-protectionism, and this has proved to be a hindrance to our advance and development.\nWith a firm view and stand that they assume full responsibility for their work before the Party and the state, they should always rack their brains to find ways for better successes and more substantial results and work with devotion to achieve them.\nIf it is for the sake of the revolution, they should not argue about the limits of responsibility or consider benefits first with a self-centred approach, but instead take the lead in undertaking a task, however challenging it may be\u2013this is the attitude of a genuine revolutionary, the attitude of a master.\nOfficials should do away with the indifferent and self-centred practice of staying aloof from any problems that are beyond the bounds of their responsibility, and adopt a proper stance and attitude of considering and approaching every problem in the interests of the Party and the state.\nOur officials should become faithful servants of the people, who embody loyalty to them as one of their inherent qualities.\nThe quintessence of our Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit is the people-first principle.\nIn the first days of our Party founding, the Korean communists inscribed in its sacred red flag their lofty ideals for building a new country whose masters are the people, as well as their faith and will to sacrifice themselves without hesitation for the sake of their fellow people.\nThe nearly eight decades of our Party\u2019s struggle to defend the red flag symbolizing its original ideals and spirit, represent the history of its preserving its nature and original features as a genuine party of the people. And following this course, our Party has administered the great people-first politics that is unprecedented in the political history of ruling socialist parties.\nThe people-first principle is not an abstract slogan, but it is the political creed unique to our Party, which permeates all its lines and policies and whose viability our people have experienced through their everyday life.\nDespite manifold difficulties facing the state, our Party initiated and is unfailingly carrying out gigantic projects of lasting significance to translate the people\u2019s ideals and dreams into reality, and it also ensures that the more difficulties the people experience, the deeper the whole Party goes among the masses, sharing weal and woe with them. Such traits can never be displayed or imitated by other ruling socialist parties.\nPeople-first principle\u2013this represents our Party\u2019s original features and its absolute ruling efficiency.\nOur officials\u2019 loyalty to the people should find its expression in wholeheartedly supporting the Party Central Committee\u2019s people-first politics and faithfully serving the people.\nThey should, first of all, acquire a proper view of and attitude towards the people.\nIt is self-evident that an official with an improper view of the people can neither respect nor serve them.\nOur Party has performed great and undying exploits, because since the initial days of its founding it has regarded it as its inherent mission to believe in the people as in heaven and serve them, and has made strenuous efforts to this end, thereby winning their absolute support and trust despite the passage of time and changes of generations.\nWhen a party is alienated or divorced from the people, it would be futile to talk about or think of its lines and policies, struggle and achievements. Likewise, when officials are separated from the people, it would be pointless to speak about their worth.\nOfficials should never deviate from the view that the people do not exist for the sake of cadres, but the latter exists for the sake of the former, and from the stand and attitude of regarding the people as sacred beings and respecting them as their mentors at any time and under any circumstances.\nAt its historic Eighth Congress, our Party put special emphasis on holding higher the ideals of \u201cThe people are god\u201d as well as single-hearted unity and self-reliance, and declared them to the whole world. Officials should cherish its real intention deep in their mind, be infinitely courteous and sincere to the people and remain faithful to the duty as their true servants.\nMost recently, we have brought the residents in the flood-hit areas to the capital city and taken warm care of them with sincerity while giving education to their children, and decided to add the construction of advanced public health facilities, facilities for science, education and cultural activities, and grain management facilities to the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy. All these are the revolutionary measures which clearly testify to our Party\u2019s faith that the people are its god.\nOur officials, whatever they do, should consider whether it would infringe upon the demands and interests of the people and whether it would cause any inconvenience to them, and should approach and deal with the arising problems from their standpoint and from the viewpoint of providing convenience to them and promoting their wellbeing.\nThey should cherish the boundless trust of the people, who call the Workers\u2019 Party mother, as the greatest confidence in and expectations of them, regard it as their duty to find out and take charge of new things for them and make positive efforts to find solutions to the problems, eagerly awaited by them.\nIt is of particular importance to be prudent in words and deeds in acquiring the traits as befitting an official of the Party.\nAs always, officials\u2019 moral traits are a serious political issue directly related with the prestige of the Party.\nI stress once again: if officials make a slightest mistake in words or deeds before the people, they will lower the prestige of the Party and estrange the masses from it.\nThe revolutionary forerunners, who had laid firm foundations of the Party and secured its authority in the early days after its founding, performed feats in their work to be praised by all. However, there was no gap between them and their fellow people, and they built up the foundations for establishing a sound climate in the Party by dint of their unique people-oriented spirit and methods of working with them.\nOfficials should always be courteous with bright facial expression whenever they approach the masses, be they ten or one, and give sincere advice to those who made a mistake and lead them forward.\nThey should be infinitely humble in front of the masses and mix with them unceremoniously, and every of their words and deeds should overflow with the ennobling moral traits and warm human feelings of respecting and caring for them.\nWe should keep intensifying the struggle to root out the abuses of power, bureaucracy and accumulation of wealth by illicit means.\nThese negative practices are the main targets of struggle, which fundamentally run counter to our Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit.\nOfficials should refrain from harbouring such ideas of demanding uncommon treatment while regarding themselves as exceptional beings and seeking only their own interests by abusing their power, but make it part of their habit to lead the same life with other people.\nTimes have changed a lot since the days of Party founding, but its mode of existence and activities\u2013sharing weal and woe with the people and standing in the vanguard of their struggle\u2013remains unchanged.\nIf any slightest manifestation is revealed among them of the abuses of power, bureaucracy and accumulation of wealth by illicit means, it will do harm to the Party and leave a blot on their political integrity. Bearing this in mind, they should control and temper themselves, working and living modestly, simply and frugally.\nIn addition, they should not spare comradely advice and help to other officials working with them so as to ensure that any trifling practice of the abuses of power, bureaucracy and corruption is not revealed among them. They should also make continuous efforts to awaken and educate their family members and relatives lest they commit any unsound practice.\nIn order to become communist revolutionaries who are possessed of the Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit as their mental qualities, our officials should intensify their studies.\nStudying is the primary process for them to acquire and steadily improve their Party, revolutionary and people-oriented spirit; it is also an important way for the revolutionary transformation of cadres.\nFully aware that studying hard is the essential requirement for their training in the Party spirit and their revolutionary self-improvement, officials should study voluntarily, diligently and substantially.\nPrimary attention should be paid to the studies aimed at arming themselves with the Party\u2019s lines and policies.\nOur Party\u2019s revolutionary ideology is the ever-victorious banner leading the cause of Juche, providing absolutely correct guidelines for ushering in a golden age in building up the Party and achieving national prosperity in the new era.\nOfficials should regard it as a vital task to arm themselves with the Party\u2019s ideology and policies, keeping in mind that, without a correct understanding of them, they can neither be faithful to the important responsibility and duties entrusted to them by the Party nor breathe the same air as, and keep step with, the advance of the times.\nThey should firmly equip themselves with our Party\u2019s revolutionary ideology by conducting an in-depth study of its documents in a chronological order and in a systematic and comprehensive way, thereby making it an element of their firm faith.\nIn particular, they should intensify their study of the Party\u2019s current policies, such as the new policy on regional development, until they correctly grasp the gist of those policies, and then identify what they need to do for their implementation and take practical steps to this end.\nIn arming themselves with our Party\u2019s ideology and theories, they should put the particular emphasis on effectively studying its line of building up the Party in the new era.\nMindful of the Party Central Committee\u2019s intention to usher in a new golden age of building up the Party by carrying forward its original ideals and spirit, they should study hard to grasp the essence, originality, viability and great vitality of the five-point line of building up the Party and make it an element of their faith, and find ways for applying it in practice.\nThey should also conduct an in-depth study of how our Party was founded and has been developed.\nThe new golden age of building up the Party should start with studying how our Party was founded and has been developed and learning from the ennobling spirit of our forerunners who made an undying contribution to pioneering and advancing the cause of building a Juche-oriented party\u2013this is our Party\u2019s requirement.\nAll the officials should be so effective in studying the history of our Party in various forms and by various methods that they can gain knowledge, which is as good as first-hand experience, of how the first-generation revolutionaries went against all odds to pioneer the great cause of Party building and carry it through with credit, and of how hard the second- and third-generation revolutionaries have worked by carrying forward their predecessors\u2019 soul and spirit.\nThey should also be well aware of how dearly they paid for the creation of our Party\u2019s history and tradition of unity and cohesion unprecedented in the history of the building of revolutionary parties, the ruling socialist parties in particular, and of how the fighters of the preceding generations defended the Party Central Committee and the revolution in times of grave trials.\nIn order to become communist revolutionaries embodying the Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit, officials should cultivate and train themselves in a revolutionary way through Party life.\nParty life is a school for revolutionary education and a furnace for revolutionary training, where officials can acquire and consolidate their loyalty to the Party, the revolution and the people.\nBearing in mind that whoever neglects Party life and fails to temper their loyalty to the Party will degenerate in spite of themselves and end up being traitors and renegades of the revolution, officials should enhance their loyalty to the Party and revolutionary temperament by taking a voluntary and sincere part in Party life.\nOfficials should participate in Party life faithfully with a high appreciation of Party organization, just as rank-and-file Party members do\u2013this is an obligation stipulated in the Party Rules and a course of their cultivating revolutionary traits.\nThe anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters made efforts to enhance their loyalty to the Party by reviewing their Party life by themselves even in the throes of successive battles and marches; learning from their ennobling examples, officials should respect the Party organization and take a fully responsible attitude and approach towards its decisions.\nBy taking a voluntary and sincere part in Party meetings, reviews of Party life and Party study sessions, they should establish a regularized climate of obeying Party discipline and working and living accordingly, and get into the habit of making conscious efforts to place themselves under the Party organization\u2019s guidance and control.\nThey should train themselves ideologically and enhance their Party awareness through intensive criticism and ideological campaign.\nSelf-reflection and principled, comradely criticism are the most efficacious of political \u201ctonics,\u201d which help our officials work harder with a strong sense of their basic duty as Party members and revolutionaries, and ideological campaign is a fundamental method for transforming cadres along revolutionary lines.\nOfficials should review their Party life conscientiously now and then according to the Party Rules and regulations, and they should be frank with the Party organization about their mistakes and be bold in correcting them.\nWhen others make a mistake, they should give them principled criticism based on the Party\u2019s ideology, policies and discipline and, not confining themselves to doing so, help them with all sincerity so that they can rectify their mistake.\nSuccess or failure in preparing officials to be genuine communist revolutionaries embodying the Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit depends largely on the role of Party organizations.\nOfficials\u2019 self-consciousness alone is not enough to enhance their loyalty to the Party, the revolution and the people.\nIf we connive at, and take a hands-off approach towards, any signs of unorganized, undisciplined or negative practice that may be revealed among officials, we cannot maintain the Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit. This will end up failing to provide a sure guarantee for the future of the Party and the revolution.\nParty organizations at all levels, fully aware that transforming cadres along revolutionary lines is a crucial matter that has a direct bearing on the destiny of the Party and the successful accomplishment of the socialist cause, should strengthen the education and control of officials and establish strict discipline within the Party.\nThey should make exacting demands on officials to be fully conversant with the Party\u2019s regulations and order and strictly observe them in and out of work; they should also exercise tight control and guidance so that the officials draw up detailed action plans, work according to them and exert themselves in implementing their assignments to produce substantial results.\nThey should be effective in educating and controlling officials lest they act contrary to the Party\u2019s principles and discipline in the course of directing the lower-echelon units or in their daily activities; once they reveal any negative practice, they must never connive at it, instead making an issue of it and helping them rectify it.\nBy taking into account the requirements of the developing revolution and the preparedness of officials, they should work out detailed methodology to transform them along revolutionary lines and make persevering efforts to this end, correcting deviations in time, if any, and steadily intensifying this work.\nNext year is very significant in that our glorious Party will greet its 80th founding anniversary and its Central Committee will wind up its eighth term.\nFrom now on, we should make good preparations for celebrating this anniversary of our Party as a grand political festival that will proudly review its longest history as a ruling socialist party and mark a watershed in opening up a new, great era of building up the Party and the country.\nIn addition, we should successfully carry out the policy-oriented tasks put forward by the Eighth Party Congress.\nAll the officials should embody the Party\u2019s original ideals and spirit, and they should remain faithful to their responsibility and duty as the leading personnel of the revolution in the ongoing drive to open up a golden age for strengthening the whole party and achieving national prosperity.\nFilled with greater conviction and mounting morale, we are advancing more vigorously and confidently to bring earlier the victory of socialist and communist construction by carrying forward the invaluable and sacred ideals and spirit.\nThe intention in pioneering the cause of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea was a truth, and its victory is a truth as well.\nThe great soul of our forerunners is encouraging us.\nLet us all endeavour to keep up the revolutionary upsurge in the new era by making redoubled efforts to achieve proud results with a strong sense of honour and responsibility as befitting the hard core of the great Party and the leading personnel of the revolution. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, October 11 (KCNA) -- Kim Myong Chol, an international affairs analyst of the DPRK, issued the following article titled \"Present situation of the U.S. and the ROK alliance on defence cost sharing negotiations\":\nRecently, the U.S. and the ROK concluded the negotiations for signing the 12th special agreement on defence cost sharing which had been held since April.\nAccording to it, the ROK is expected to bear about 1 130 million US dollars, 8.3 percent above the previous year, in 2026, the first year of the agreement. And they agreed to adjust the annual rate of increase in the next four years in reflection of consumers' price index, etc.\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State said that the alliance between the U.S. and the ROK has been the linchpin of peace, security, and prosperity for Northeast Asia, the broader Indo-Pacific region, and beyond, adding that the agreement will be a significant accomplishment for both sides, and will strengthen their alliance and their shared defense.\nThrough the triumphant face of the master who celebrated the early agreement of the negotiation for the defence cost sharing by itself, the world people can feel once again the satisfaction of the U.S. forces in the ROK who will lead a luxurious life while receiving a huge amount of money on the pretext of defending the other state's security and the servility of the poor colonial stooge who have to beg for security while paying huge blood taxes collected from the people.\nSince 1991, the ROK has been charged with the construction of bases for the U.S. forces' presence, payment of local employee wages, etc. Since then, the rising rate has increased steadily and produced the present high figure.\nBut the U.S., the master like a famished lion, has forced the sharply increased defence cost sharing, while talking about the \"theory of withdrawal of the U.S. forces from the ROK\" by opening the \"lion's mouth\" widely.\nThe lightning conclusion of the negotiation is a good thing for the ROK, which experienced the desperate situation by tremendous amount of money imposed by its master during the past administration.\nHowever, the present U.S. administration, which is near the end of its term, hastily concluded the negotiations with its sinister purpose though the 11th \"special agreement on the defence cost sharing\" concluded in 2021 has been expired for one year.\nThe U.S. is bent on rallying its followers into new military blocs while reenergizing its-led bilateral and multilateral alliances, claiming that it cannot prevent the rapid growth of the anti-U.S. independent forces that are accelerating the definite change in the international mechanical structure by itself.\nIn particular, the puppet ROK depends on its political, economic and military sovereignty to the U.S. in the aspect of carrying out its long-term strategy to contain the DPRK and its neighboring countries and maintain the hegemony in the region. The ROK is the U.S. \"asset\" to easily use for its strategy.\nThe present U.S. administration admitted that it \"fairly\" set the cost sharing. This is a revelation of its sinister intention to emphasize the firm commitment made by the U.S. in its defence of the ROK and to keep using it as a shock brigade in establishing the U.S.-led \"free order\" by thrilling the stooges.\nThe ROK groups were keen on the new agreement on cost sharing in the light of their smart calculation to meet their interests to the maximum with the present chief executive who seems to be easy to deal with before the master of the White House is replaced.\nHowever, how can the agreement which was made based on the far-fetched magnanimity of the master with a half heart to appease its dispirited ally and the selfish purpose of its servant contribute to the security of the ROK?\nThe precedent that the U.S. forced to include in the defence cost sharing the expense for the deployment of the U.S. strategic assets and for the maintenance of THAAD under the pretext of protecting the ROK clearly shows the true picture of the U.S.-style mode of dealing.\nDemanding the revision of the \"note on crisis control of the U.S. - ROK alliance\" in 2019, the U.S. insisted that the range of the alliance's crisis control should be revised not only \"in contingency of the Korean peninsula\" but also \"in contingency of the U.S.\" In this regard, the \"expense for supporting the U.S. forces in the ROK for contributing to the defence of the Korean peninsula\" which included the U.S.-ROK \"special negotiation on defence cost sharing\" can not preclude the possibility of being diverted to the accomplishment of duty in Taiwan and other regions of the Korean peninsula anytime in the future, pursuant to the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy and its policy of bolstering strategic flexibility.\nThis eloquently proves that the defence cost sharing between the U.S. and the ROK, which was limited to the upkeep of the U.S. forces in the ROK, can be expended in a multi-purpose way for implementing the U.S. strategy for hegemony and that the increasing rate of the defence cost sharing from the ROK side is bound to be drawn a steep ascending curve.\nThe negotiation on defence cost sharing, which was concluded hastily, is a product of the political and strategic calculation and sinister scheme of the empire of evils to use the ROK puppets, who are at greater risk of security uneasiness and future danger of huge cost sharing, as a shock brigade for carrying out the strategy for world supremacy while more tightly seizing them as a faithful watchdog by showing \"magnanimity\" and \"good will\" and imposing huge amount of money on them continuously.\nThe conclusion of the negotiation shows that there can be no change in the basic attribute of the subordinating and unequal relations between the master and the servant, no matter how much the relations between the U.S. and the ROK are beautified with flattering words \"alliance\".\nWhenever the master of the White House is replaced, the puppet ROK has to be seized with uneasiness over various issues ranging from security and economy to the cost of the U.S. forces' presence in it as a deserted woman. This fatalistic situation clearly shows the weakness of the U.S.-ROK alliance advertising the \"supreme blood alliance\" and \"true friendly relations\".\nThis is the present situation of the U.S.-ROK alliance, intertwined with mutual deception and selfish pursuit of benefit, and the fair evaluation of the world people. -0-",

However, he asserts defiance is the correct answer. It seems that he has secured an assurance of recurrence prevention although he says he doesn't know the one behind the case.\nThe world has clearly heard such absurd remarks unhesitatingly let out by a guy responsible for the security of the ROK.\nAny tiny spark may trigger an armed clash on the Korean peninsula physically in a state of hostilities.\nSo it is needless to say that the infiltration of drones playing a primary striking role on current battlefields into airspace above the capital city of a belligerent country constitutes an undeniable war provocation.\nNow a hair-trigger situation, in which a war may break out any moment, is prevailing on the Korean peninsula due to the reckless bravery of the ROK's military.\nNow that powerful attack means might be used according to our judgment and decision and the whole ROK might turn into piles of ashes, the man with the title of security office chief only busies himself with face saving, bluffing with nasty language and gambling with the lives of his people. We are curious about the follow-up rating of his behavior.\nThen, let us consider once again the stand of the ROK's minister of defense taking an ambiguous stand without denying or acknowledging the current situation.\nThe drone that had infiltrated into the sky above the capital city of our Republic is not the one that can be flied by a civilian organization anywhere.\nIt is the one to be flied with special launcher or runway so such excuse that it was flied by civilians can not work.\nThen, let's assume that the drone provocation was committed by a civilian organization used as an excuse, as claimed by the Ministry of Defense of the ROK.\nCan it be understood that its military and police, which claim are put on \"high alert\", failed to notice civilian organizations flying drones across the border by using a launcher or a runway?\nWe have already judged that the military of the ROK is behind a series of drone infiltrations. And we warn repeatedly that we will take action according to our judgment, regarding any drones to be spotted again as the ones from the ROK and deeming it a declaration of war.\nIt had better interpret the meaning of the word \"terrible ruin\" and judge what choice we will make true to our declaration about terrible ruin. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, October 14 (KCNA) -- Kim Ryo Won, an international security analyst of the DPRK, issued the following article titled \"Japan's 'reinvasion' ship will be doomed to sinking\":\nBeing preoccupied by the ambition for reinvasion with the confrontation current of a \"new Cold War\" brought by the U.S., Japan gets hell-bent on the reckless moves for turning itself into a military giant, escalating the military tension in the region.\nThe latest attack submarine Chogei (giant whale), be officially commissioned as a main warship of the Japan Maritime \"Self-Defense Force\", revealed its shape on the sea on October 4.\nThis submarine is the fifth of those eight attack submarines of Taigei (big whale) type planned to be built till 2030. Reportedly this ship has been improved further than existing ones in terms of displacement, submergence capability and search function and it was also designed to ensure the launch of heavy torpedoes and anti-warship missiles.\nJapan, which is draining the sea of its resources by hunting for food such whales under international protection at random, now launches into the sea menacing entities transformed into \"monster whales\". This is another dangerous act of harming the regional security environment.\nJapan has built attack submarines one after another since it established a system of 22 submarines in 2022. Such moves were prompted by its intention to increase the promptness and effectiveness of preemptive attack by loading on those submarines long-range missiles and guided missiles to be newly developed and, at the same time, to enhance the naval operation capability and thus seize the naval supremacy.\nThis goes to prove that Japan is still seeking its ambition for \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\".\nJapan is getting frantic with the possession of aircraft carriers, new-type Aegis warships and latest submarines, the development of various kinds of missiles and new-generation fighters and the deployment of such ultra-modern offensive weapons. The military expansion of Japan extending into all spheres such as outer space, sea and cyber, arouses serious concern not only in the international community but also in Japanese society.\nThe Japanese reactionaries give to their newly-building warships such names of notorious warships as Taigei involved in the aggressive war in the last century. The fact vividly shows the present nature of the Japan Maritime \"SDF\" closely resembling the old Japanese navy and their yearning for the past and revanchism.\nJapan's final aim of vociferating about \"threat from its neighboring countries\" so often is also to cover up its extremely adventurous and provocative moves for arms buildup, which have systematically violated the regional geopolitical security balance, zealously pursuant to the U.S. policy, with a veil of lawfulness and rightness.\nFar from liquidating the unprecedented blood-stained crimes committed against the peoples of Asian countries in the last century, Japan, a war criminal state, is running headlong along a reinvasion track, throwing away the veil of \"pacifist country\" and \"exclusive defense\", with the wild ambition to become the \"leader\" of the region again. Its arms buildup comes to the surface as the biggest threat seriously disturbing the regional peace and stability.\nJapan is gradually widening the radius of its military operations in the Asia-Pacific region while talking about \"the harshest and most complicated security environment after the war\".  Such action will only invite serious distrust and antagonism of regional countries and, inevitably, be led to the geopolitical and strategic isolation of the island country.\nJapan's \"reinvasion ship\", which is making the ocean dirty, pursuant to the U.S. trying to use its junior allies as the puppets dashing even at jaws of death and as bullet shields for maintaining its hegemony, will be doomed to sinking.\nThe end of the Imperial Japanese Army teaches it. -0-",

Earlier, a high-ranking official of the U.S. Department of State was closeted with those from its vassal countries on the theme of \"human rights\" in the UN arena.\nNotably, the \"human rights envoy\" of the U.S. Department of State asserted that \"influx of information and spread of religion\" in the DPRK constitute the \"core pillar of the U.S. policy toward north Korea,\" thus acknowledging that it is the goal of the current U.S. administration's policy toward the DPRK to bring its ideology and social system to collapse.\nThe Foreign Ministry of the DPRK strongly denounces and rejects the \"human rights\" trumpeting of the U.S., the world's worst human right abuser country, branding it as a wanton violation of the dignity and sovereignty of our state and a grave politically-motivated provocation against it.\nNow the attempts to overthrow social systems of other countries and moves to interfere in their internal affairs, being openly committed by the U.S. under the signboard of \"human rights, have become the root cause of fomenting political disorder and armed conflicts and causing massacres of civilians across the world. This proves that the \"human rights\" farce and \"information influx\" spearheaded by the U.S. are, indeed, the most serious threat to global peace and stability.\nWitnessing the crude and mean behavior of the present U.S. administration seeking to \u201cdecorate\u201d the finale of its term with such disgusting anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket, we can clearly see the inner world of the White House exasperated by the situation of its DPRK policy that has been worn out structurally and has gone belly up politically.\nThe U.S. should be aware that its futile \"human rights\" racket will only further highlight the true colors of its \"denuclearization\" policy that ended in a real flop.\nSteadfast is our determination and will to firmly defend our national sovereignty, political system and wellbeing of the people politically, physically and legally, coping with the U.S. and its followers' ever-aggravating anti-DPRK \"human rights\" moves.\nThe DPRK will mercilessly eliminate any objects and elements posing a threat to its sovereignty and security and continue to take practical measures to defend the rights and interests of its people with recourse to its great strength.\nThis will inevitably hasten the arrival of the reality that the U.S. doesn\u2019t wish and is most afraid of. -0-",

And he approved the determination of the corps. Then he said:\nOur army should keep in mind once again the stark fact that the ROK is a foreign and indisputable enemy state. We completely blocked the roads and railways linked to the territory of the ROK two days ago through blasting. It means not only the physical closure but also the end of the undesirable relationship with Seoul, which persistently lasted century after century, and the complete removal of the useless awareness about fellow countrymen and unrealistic idea of reunification. It also means the last declaration that when our sovereignty is violated by the ROK, a complete enemy state, our physical forces will be used unhesitatingly without being tied to the conditions any longer. As we have already declared, if our offensive forces are used under the precondition of \u201cif,\u201d it will be a lawful retaliatory action against the enemy state, not the fellow countrymen.\nOnly the peace defended with the strength powerful enough to control and deter the enemy is a reliable, safe, lasting one, and herein lies a sure guarantee for the well-being and future of our state and people.\nThen he reaffirmed that our army must grow more powerful and will become powerful without fail for such genuine peace.\nThat day, he had a photo session with the officers and men of the headquarters of the unit.\nWhen he came to the venue of the photo session, the officers and men broke into enthusiastic cheers with great gratitude to the invincible and iron-willed commander who taught them ever-victorious tactics and instilled matchless bravery and confidence in them and is leading our army along the road of victory.\nKim Jong Unexpressed the expectation and belief that all the officers and men of the large combined unit will reliably defend the southern border of the country by always remaining true to their mission and duty as honourable defenders and soldiers on the outposts for defending the sovereignty of the country and the safety of the people.\nThe shout of \u201cDeath-defying defence\u201d let out by the soldiers looking up to him resounded far and wide in the sky of October.\nAll the officers and men pledged to fight death-defyingly for the great ComradeKim Jong Un, our great country, our great Party and our great people.

No wonder, it has gone as foolish as to hype a \"rumor about photo,\" something completely irrelevant to the matter.\nDancing to that tune, media and so-called experts are busy with a detailed analysis, talking about \"camera angle\" and \"shape of smoke\".\nThey have nothing to do more significant, haven't they?\nTheir behavior makes even a cat laugh.\nI would like to inform those idiots of the fact that the photo is a screenshot from one of the video clips released by NBC, Fox News, Reuters and other foreign media.\nWe cannot take a photo at that angle. So we used that photo, finding that it met our intention, being visually good and excellent in composition.\nIs it problematic?\nHasn't the ROK used the photos and video clips released by KCNA when airing the news about us?\nThen a question arises as to whether the ROK thought about a violation of international law and copyright when reporting the news about us with our photos and video clips.\nIt is their unreasonable criterion that nothing matters when they do so but when we do it, it is a violation of international law and copyright. I would like to make them unable to say anything more at once.\nAccording to our initial investigation, Yonhap News, Kyunghyang Daily News and other media of the puppet ROK all abused the two photos of explosion opened to public by us for their news report.\nIt seems that it is necessary to probe into whether our approval was secured in the ROK where international law is allegedly well observed.\nThis is just chicanery peculiar to the ROK, the country without a parallel in the world in abusing international law, international standard, principle and generally accepted value for their benefits and hurting others.\nIts Joint Chiefs of Staff in charge of defending security of its country should properly investigate the grave violation of the sovereignty and security of our Republic first, instead of disgracing itself by engaging in such a deed unbecoming to its position as photo assessment.\nThey will be watched until they refrain from dodging and feigning ignorance.\nExplicitly speaking once again, we are clearly aware that the ROK has severely violated our sovereignty.\nCuriosity arises as to how much they will get for shirking responsibility and letting out nonsense.\nThey are, indeed, weird ones. -0-",

This is an unpardonable and unfair behavior of double-standards.\nThe UN secretary-general made the prejudiced remarks, instead of standing at a strictly neutral position in the present situation on the Korean peninsula where the possibility of armed conflict is becoming a reality. It is little short of giving a green light to the U.S. and the ROK army's attempt to ignite a war against the DPRK.\nIn case an incident which nobody wants occurs on the Korean peninsula due to the reckless military temerity of the ROK with the back of the U.S., the UN secretary-general will never be free from responsibility for it as he incited the warmongers' fever with an undisguised behavior of availing himself of and following them. -0-",

The group, driven into a tight corner due to its untold evil deeds and fascist dictatorship which fomented the war crisis and resulted in economic bankruptcy, people's destitution and disasters, is engrossed in war gambling with the lives of the people to get rid of its ruling crisis, and such action should never be allowed, they said.\nOn the same day, there took place the 111th candlelight rally and demonstration on the theme of \"Down with Yoon-Kon Hui, the war tyrant and kingpin of injustices!\"\nThe speakers at the candlelight rally charged that Yoon is instigating the military to provoke armed conflict in a bid to maintain his power and wielding the prosecution dictatorship to hush up the hideous scandals of his wife Kim Kon Hui and, in this way, driving the whole ROK into the crucible of war and the cesspool of corruption.\nMeanwhile, the candlelight action made public a \"bill on impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol\" carrying the public demand.\nIn the rally, there was a ceremony of tearing down placards with the letters \"trickster for war martial law\" and the dirty looks of Yoon group and Kim Kon Hui.\nThen a resolution on intensive candlelight demonstrations in October was read out.\nAt the end of the rally, its participants staged a demonstration, chanting slogans and holding large placards and posters with such letters reading \"Down with Yoon-Kon Hui!\"\nThe demonstrators with candlelight in their hands expressed their will to continue the struggle until puppet Yoon has been impeached. -0-",

The group, driven into a tight corner due to its untold evil deeds and fascist dictatorship which fomented the war crisis and resulted in economic bankruptcy, people's destitution and disasters, is engrossed in war gambling with the lives of the people to get rid of its ruling crisis, and such action should never be allowed, they said.\nOn the same day, there took place the 111th candlelight rally and demonstration on the theme of \"Down with Yoon-Kon Hui, the war tyrant and kingpin of injustices!\"\nThe speakers at the candlelight rally charged that Yoon is instigating the military to provoke armed conflict in a bid to maintain his power and wielding the prosecution dictatorship to hush up the hideous scandals of his wife Kim Kon Hui and, in this way, driving the whole ROK into the crucible of war and the cesspool of corruption.\nMeanwhile, the candlelight action made public a \"bill on impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol\" carrying the public demand.\nIn the rally, there was a ceremony of tearing down placards with the letters \"trickster for war martial law\" and the dirty looks of Yoon group and Kim Kon Hui.\nThen a resolution on intensive candlelight demonstrations in October was read out.\nAt the end of the rally, its participants staged a demonstration, chanting slogans and holding large placards and posters with such letters reading \"Down with Yoon-Kon Hui!\"\nThe demonstrators with candlelight in their hands expressed their will to continue the struggle until puppet Yoon has been impeached. -0-",

And he clarified the measures to be taken by the state in the future in overcoming the relevant matters arising in the rehabilitation and in launching a vigorous struggle for the overall regional construction.\nRecalling that he has already stressed many times that architecture is an extension of politics as it is criterion showing the degree of the idea, national power and civilization in a visual way, and, therefore, even if a building is built, we should regard it as the one related with the self-respect, dignity and honor of our times, he said that some deviations underrating the structural quality have yet been revealed and they should be rectified.\nJust like monumental edifices rising all over the country, the dwelling houses under construction for the flood victims, too, are precious assets of the state and the people that should be guaranteed forever, and therefore, it is necessary to overcome even the slightest shortcomings perfectly and direct greater efforts to ensuring perfection, he said, adding that a decision will be made to prolong the completion of the housing projects for the disaster areas, scheduled to be finished by early November, to early December.\nHe gave detailed instructions on taking practical measures to ensure that the inhabitants and schoolchildren of the flood-hit areas staying in Pyongyang could not feel inconvenience in their living, as regards the delay of the housing construction.\nNoting that lots of houses for the flood victims are being built all at once in every flood-hit area of the country thanks to the heroic struggle of the Party members, youths and service personnel and to the support of all the people in the country, he said this gigantic work is not confined to the practical issue for housing construction but a crucial political issue of defending the character of our style socialist system based on the people-first principle and demonstrating its advantages. And he set forth the tasks for completing the project, calling on all the builders to further fully display their extraordinary patriotic enthusiasm and indomitable will so as to successfully complete the construction of houses and provide them to the flood victims with delight.\nHe stressed the need to further enhance the requirements and role of construction control organs.\nHe also gave detailed instructions on the important tasks such as the issue of ensuring timely and responsible transport and supply of materials without hindering the schedule of the project, the issue of properly greening the residential areas along with the housing construction and the issue of taking good care of the builders' living conditions.\nThat day the Secretariat of the WPK Central Committee decided to newly dispatch the chief and the political chief of the field headquarters for rehabilitating the flood-hit areas in Jagang Province.\nExpressing expectation and belief that the Party members, youths and service personnel, whom the Party Central Committee dispatched to the difficult and arduous yet sacred and worthwhile struggle with deep trust, would remain faithful to their heavy mission to the end in the patriotic construction theaters for the country and the people, he ardently called for making redoubled efforts once again to build a splendid paradise for the people in the flood-hit areas without fail.\nAll the builders were filled with a firm determination to make the flames of loyalty and patriotism flare up more highly and vigorously struggle for the socialist country, responding with a firm pledge to the ardent call of the Party Central Committee. -0-",

This shows that G7 has turned definitely into a \"club of war\", not a \"club of economy\".\nIt is a vivid manifestation of the double standards, a wanton challenge to international peace and an open declaration of new Cold War in the world that they justify the expansion of their defense industry and term sovereign states' exercise of legitimate rights \"threats\", while talking about \"incompatibility-brought confrontation\".\nToday G7 has become the primary political servant for ensuring the U.S. hegemony.\nG7's grave moves to further foster and expand the war of aggression under the pompous signboard of \"international security and prosperity\" are getting ever more undisguised in the Korean peninsula.\nG7's interference in the Korean peninsula issue actually means the military expansion of NATO, the global war alliance.\nNATO has invited the puppet ROK to its summit since 2022 and its secretary general was recently closeted with puppet Yoon Suk Yeol to discuss the intensified \"cooperation system\" against the DPRK.\nMeanwhile, Western countries, NATO member states and member states of G7, which account for the backbone of the U.S.-led \u201cUN Command\u201d, are directly involved in the war drills for aggression against the DPRK.\nWestern countries are working hard to make the flames of war in Europe spill over into Asia, claiming \"Asia and Europe are inseparable in terms of security\". This grave reality seriously teaches that G7 has rapidly developed into a global \"war contractor group\".\nThe U.S. is now scheming to establish an axis of war serving its strategy for hegemony by rallying all its servants, including G7, in which war criminal states that inflicted huge damage on mankind in the last century hold a majority, and NATO, the worst-ever group seeking military confrontation.\nG7 is committing an act of robbing others in broad daylight without shame and getting increasingly vocal in condemning someone's measures for bolstering up self-defensive capabilities. It had better look at its despicable image reflected in the eyes of the international community before pointing an accusing finger at others.\nThe more desperately G7, which is no more than a \"shadow\" of the U.S., slanders the DPRK's policy of the state nuclear force, bereft of reason, the more clearly it will betray its criminal colors as a harasser of peace, confrontation maniac and war merchant.\nExplicitly speaking again, those who seek to deprive the DPRK of its inviolable right will have to pay a high price for it. -0-",

The fact showed that G7 was definitely changed into a \"club of war\", not a \"club of economy\".\nIt is a manifestation of the undisguised double standards, a clear challenge to international peace and an open declaration of a war bringing a new Cold War in the world that they justify the expansion of their defense industry and term sovereign states' exercise of legitimate rights \"threats\", while clamoring about \"unblended confrontation\".\nToday G7 is submissively serving as a political servant, a first-class servitor for ensuring the U.S. unchallenged position.\nG7's grave moves to further fan up and expand the war of aggression under the beautiful signboard of \"international security and prosperity\" are getting ever more undisguised in the Korean peninsula.\nG7's interference in the Korean peninsula issue means, in fact, the military expansion of NATO, the global war alliance.\nSince 2022, NATO has made the puppet ROK take part in its summit regularly and its secretary general recently sat with puppet Yoon Suk Yeol to discuss the strengthening of the \"cooperation system\" against the DPRK.\nMeanwhile, the Western countries, the member states of G7 which form the parent body of the U.S.-led UN Command and the member states of NATO, are directly joining in the war drills for aggression against the DPRK.\nThe serious reality that the Western countries are making desperate efforts to move the European battlefield to Asia, claiming \"Asia and Europe are inseparable in guaranteeing security\", intensely shows that G7 has rapidly developed into the world-wide \"war contractor group \".\nThe U.S. is now scheming to form one pole of war serving its strategy for hegemony by bringing together all its servants, including G7 mainly composed of the war criminal states that inflicted huge damage on mankind in the last century, and NATO, the ever worst group of military confrontation.\nG7 is dancing to the tune of others. It is committing an act of robbing other's property in broad daylight without shame and making desperate efforts without reason to condemn someone's measures for bolstering up the capabilities for self-defence. It will be good for G7 to look at its despicable nature in the international community before shaking its fist at others.\nThe more desperately G7, only a \"shadow\" of the U.S., slanders the DPRK's policy of the state nuclear force without any sense of orientation, the more clearly it will reveal its criminal entity as a harasser of peace, confrontation maniac and war merchant.\nExplicitly speaking again, those who seek to deprive the inviolable right of the DPRK will have to pay a high price for it. -0-",

And it has resorted to extreme confrontation hysteria, openly claiming that the purpose of the drill is aimed at the DPRK.\nThe U.S. and the ROK are trumpeting that they would master the compound operation capability by mobilizing fighters and drones for the first time and conduct exercises for increasing the survivability in airborne infiltration into an enemy's position through the large-scale joint air drill which integrates the annual combined joint formation drill and a joint air drill Vigilant Defense.\nThe military drill of the U.S. and the ROK, which shows the offensive and aggressive nature more vividly in its scale, content and character, is a very dangerous military provocation aimed at preemptive and surprise strike at the DPRK.\nThe U.S. is staging \"joint air re-supply drill\" and \"joint river-crossing drill\" with the ROK and a large-scale marine corps' joint military drill Keen Sword with Japan. At the same time, it is further escalating the military tension while dispatching the super-large nuclear carrier George Washington task force around the Korean peninsula.\nWe strongly denounce the U.S. hostile act of resorting to reckless military demonstration with its allies, not content with the present political and military tension on the Korean peninsula which is exposed to the danger of a touch-and-go explosion, as a clear threat and a grave provocation to the security of the region.\nThe U.S. can never cover up its criminal nature of driving the situation on the Korean peninsula into an uncontrollable one with any rhetoric.\nIt is a fact known to the world that the ROK committed illegal and grave provocation of openly infiltrating military attack means into the sky above a sovereign state under the shelter of \"military cooperation\" with someone.\nThe DPRK keeps in sight the dark shadow of the U.S. which is hidden behind the fearless provocative acts of the ROK.\nThe U.S. has patronized the ROK's scattering of political motivational rubbish over the territory of the DPRK as the so-called \"freedom of expression\" and instigated the bellicose hysteria of its ally with frequent deployment of strategic assets and ceaseless joint military drills. The U.S. confrontation history will be exactly recorded and calculated.\nIf a situation that no one wishes is created on the Korean peninsula, the U.S., the arch criminal and mastermind escalating the tension in the region, will be held wholly responsible for it. -0-",

Its participants warned that it is the will of the people to impeach Yoon and if lawmakers turn down this public mindset, they will become a target of punishment. And they stressed that Yoon should be ousted from power without fail on the strength of the population.\nMeanwhile, various organizations and puppet political parties issued protest statements and commentaries all at once over the fact that the puppet Yoon group, upset by the ever-mounting public mindset on impeachment, is getting frantic with the wholesale suppression of media.\nMedia and many organizations in the puppet ROK said that such suppression is an expression of the last-ditch efforts of the fascist regime driven into the crisis of ruin, adding that the Yoon's impeachment is the trend of the times and the candlelight for impeachment will get fiercer and the population will surely impeach Yoon within this year. -0-",
