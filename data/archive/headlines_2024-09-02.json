        "story_text":"Pyongyang, December 24 (KCNA) -- Japan continues discharging nuclear-contaminated water into sea, endangering the lives and security of all mankind.\nThe Japanese authorities recently announced its plan to begin the fourth-round discharge of nuclear-polluted water into sea next February.\nThe point is that they decided not to confirm the amount of tritium in the water this time though such process had been gone through for the mere form's sake.\nJapan, which finally started the discharge of nuclear-polluted water in disregard of serious concern and uneasiness of the international community, hyping it as \"clean and treated water\", is going to release the water into sea without going through the process of identifying the amount of radioactive materials. This is just an unpardonable rash behavior of making a mockery of human life.\nThe world public still remembers the unheard-of terrible crimes Japan committed during the Second World War by organizing secret germ-warfare units like Unit 731 and Unit 516 to frantically speed up the research and production of various bio-chemical weapons and reducing Koreans and other Asian people to guinea pigs for confirming their feasibility.\nToday the descendants of the germ-warfare criminals ill-famed for inflicting untold pain and misfortune upon regional people are exposing the life and security of all mankind on Earth to serious danger by contaminating the sea, common wealth of mankind, with radioactive water.\nNo wonder, huge piles of dead sardines washed ashore in Japan in October and in December became a hot topic of world media.\nCommenting on such worrisome phenomena, foreign media described the scene as \"fish waves.\"\nRecalling that the phenomena happened three months after the discharge of radioactive water into sea off Fukushima, Daily Mail reported that this casts the suspicion that Japan's discharge of nuclear-polluted water affected the ecological system.\nAgainst this backdrop, there is a widespread public opinion in China believing that sardines were killed by nuclear contamination and deploring that Japan's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water will soon exterminate mankind.\nBut Japan has gone so far as to say \"there is no problem in safety\", impudently citing \"tolerable limit.\"\nThere is no smoke without fire.\nJapan's discharge of nuclear-polluted water is not the one merely concerning some countries and region but a high-profile hideous crime that seriously threatens all countries and regions in the world and even the distant future of mankind.\nJapan, defying the unanimous voice of the international community and mocking human life, can never evade its responsibility for the heinous crime. -0-",

And in February the following year, it seized another tanker in the waters off the United Arab Emirates, asserting that the ship is related to the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps of Iran, and plundered about 2 million barrels of oil and sold it for 110 million U.S. dollars.\nAs regards the recent capture of the U.S. oil tanker, Iran said that its action is a part of the retaliation against the U.S. oil-plundering act, declaring that \"the days when the U.S. stole oil and ran away has gone and we will not allow the U.S. to threaten our country in the region.\"\nIt is a deserved punishment for the U.S., the kingpin of modern-day \"pirate\" who does not hesitate to commit such heinous crimes as seizing other country's resources in broad daylight, not content with fattening through aggression and plunder.\nThe \"piracy\" by the U.S. is not confined to Iran only.\nAfter being stationed in Syria in a conspiratorial and brigandish way, the U.S. has stretched its tentacles of robbery not only to oil but also to grain, cotton and other agricultural products.\nEarly in January 2023, it plundered oil and wheat by mobilizing 60 tankers and trucks, and in December alone, stole a large amount of oil and food twice from Syria which suffered from earthquake damage.\nThe U.S., engrossed in plundering and robbery in different parts of the world, has disgraced itself from the outset of the year.\nIt is quite natural that the despicable plunder by the gangster-like U.S. is punished by justice. -0-",

This year they finally removed the monument in such a forcible way as \"administrative execution\".\nThis is a base act of denying the past crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists, who inflicted untold pain and misfortune upon Korea and many other countries and nations in Asia, and beautifying their colonial rule over them. It is an unpardonable unethical act of reopening the old wounds among the direct victims of forcible drafting and their descendants.\nJapan can never cover up the forcible drafting and forced labor it committed against the Korean people in the last century.\nIn order to forcibly mobilize human and material resources needed for the war of aggression on April 1, 1938, the Japanese imperialists promulgated the \"National Mobilization Law\" containing the gangster-like paragraph - \"the enactment of the current law applies to external territories (colonies).\" They also instituted or revised such evil laws as \"Ordinance on Labor Conscription\" and \"the Women's Volunteer Corps Service Ordinance\", thus forcibly drafting and abducting the Korean people into the sites of death, irrespective of their age and sex.\nThousands of forcibly drafted Korean people were forced into slave labor at munitions factories, underground factories, airports, power stations and mines in Gunma Prefecture alone.  Many Koreans lost their lives in the alien land at the end of their harsh labor and miserable life.\nIt is the legal duty and due obligation of the assailant nation to feel sorry for the victims, make reparation for the crimes and prevent the recurrence of such misfortune.\nBut the Gunma prefectural authorities revealed their anti-historical and unethical true colors and wild revanchist ambition through the unreasonable and forcible removal of the memorial monument to the Korean victims of forcible drafting.\nWhat merits a more serious attention is that the Gunma prefectural governor who led and directed the removal is a die-hard ultra-right politician steeped in hostility toward the DPRK to the marrow of his bones, and is in cahoots with the behind-the-scene forces working hard to remove the monument to the Korean victims of the great Kanto quake in Tokyo and other similar monuments across the Japanese archipelago.\nTo write off the past history is meant to repeat it.\nChongryon, Koreans in Japan and Japanese political parties and social organizations are now waging a dynamic struggle demanding the restoration of the monument, resolutely denouncing the unreasonable violence.\nThe Gunma prefectural authorities should ponder over the consequences to be entailed by the present situation which sparked off great anger at home and abroad and restore the memorial monument at once.\nThey can never evade the responsibility for the fascist violence. -0-",

This miserable reality arouses serious concern of the international community.\nEven politicians of the Western countries, pro-U.S. and pro-Israeli ones, admit that human casualties and humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip have already reached an \"intolerable\" phase, urging an urgent investigation into whether Israel has observed international law on human rights and relevant treaties.\nHowever, the U.S., often taking issue with the \"human rights situation\" of other countries and styling itself \"human rights judge\", is keeping mum about it.\nThe world is watching once again the shameless behavior of the U.S., asking why the \"human rights champion\", which used to cry out for adopting human rights resolutions, imposing sanctions on some countries with faked-up data and referring the issue to the International Court of Justice, is keeping mum about the thrice-cursed human rights abuses committed by Israel.\nWhere does the United States focus its attention?\nThere is no more obvious answer than the fact.\nThe U.S. is seeking to divert the attention of the international community by orchestrating the visit by its \"special envoy for human rights\", while feigning ignorance about the terrible human rights situation in the Gaza Strip. This clearly proves that the attention of the \"human rights judge\" is not focused on the protection of genuine human rights.\nThe U.S. seeks to tarnish the image of the anti-imperialist independent countries, which are opposed to its high-handed and arbitrary practices, under the pretext of \"human rights issue\", alienate their governments from people and finally overthrow their social systems.\nThe alternative and double-dealing American-style \"human rights\" are the means for implementing the hegemonic policy and for aggression and interference in internal affairs as such standards and countermeasures change according to whether the targets are pro-U.S. or anti-U.S.\nThe present reality, in which human rights cannot be protected if the sovereignty of the state is violated, clearly proves that the DPRK's claim - human rights precisely means the sovereignty - is entirely just.\nIf the DPRK had not defended the sovereignty of the state and firmly bolstered up its capabilities for self-defence, it would have suffered the same misfortune as the Palestinians.\nHuman rights not guaranteed by the sovereignty and strength of the state are just like building a castle on the sand. If the sovereignty is weak and the sovereignty is not defended, it is impossible to guarantee elementary right to existence, to say nothing of the dignity and development of individuals. This is a bitter lesson taught by the present world.\nWe will resolutely foil the U.S. and riff-raffs' \"human rights\" racket, regarding it as a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and the most grave challenge to its existence and development, and defend the inviolable sovereignty and genuine human rights in the future, too.\nThe special envoy for \"human rights\", engrossed in the \"human rights smear campaign against the DPRK\", had better visit the Middle East, if he or she is not a political maid of the White House but a true \"human rights champion.\" Then the envoy may get \"actual results.\" -0-",

And it sparked off bitterer curse and denunciation of the international community.\nFrom the outset of the year the U.S. secretary of State made a busy tour of Middle East countries to try to gain attention as if he was interested in peace, saying that it is necessary to prevent the vicious cycle of violence and protect civilians. And even Biden let loose a string of rhetoric about the \"ceasefire\", stunning the world people.\nShortly ago, the White House announced that Biden held a phone conversation with the Israeli prime minister and called for taking \"immediate and detailed measures\" to expand the thorough and sustained humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip.\nThe U.S. is behaving like a faithful \"apostle of peace\". One reason of such behavior is to clam down the international community's anger at Israel's massacre of Palestinian civilians. But it is nothing but a trick to relieve itself of the concern about the possibility of getting totally isolated and rejected due to its pro-Israel one-sided policy.\nThe U.S., from a historical point of view, has zealously shielded and encouraged the Zionists' moves for territorial expansion, regarding Israel as a shock brigade in realizing its strategy for dominating Middle East and has put them forward as its stooges to increase the regional chaos and instability.\nAfter the conflict in the Gaza Strip in October last year, the U.S. offered Israel a huge amount of various lethal weapons, claiming that Israel should be fully prepared for self-defense. It also collected sensitive information about the leadership of the Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine (Hamas) and the Gaza Strip and offered it to Israel.\nIsrael clearly said that all its missiles, ammunition, precision guided bombs, planes and bombs are provided by the U.S. and without the U.S., it can never fight this war. Like this, the U.S. is behind the bloody disaster in the Gaza Strip.\nDespite the growing voices of the international community calling for realizing the ceasefire and putting an end to the war, the U.S. has steadily supported Israel's massacre politically and militarily, contrary to its massive propaganda about its \"effort for ceasefire\".\nSome days ago, the U.S. Senate passed a bill on aid of more than 14 billion U.S. dollars to Israel. And the U.S. refused for a third time the resolution on the enforcement of ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, which was recently brought up to the UN Security Council.\nAfter all, the U.S. again suppressed the international community's demand for defusing humanitarian crisis and putting an end to war, thus bringing to light its true colors as a vicious harasser of Middle East peace and a rare murderer before the world people.\nAll the facts clearly prove that the \"efforts for ceasefire\" touted by the U.S. are nothing but \"crocodile's tears\" full of hypocrisy and deception.\nWith nothing can the U.S. cover up its moves to block the peaceful settlement of the crisis and keep inciting Israel to bloodshed. And it can never evade the blame for having plunged the Middle East into bloody massacre and extreme confusion. -0-",

The point is that the international order pursued by the U.S. is grounded in the law of the jungle, \"the logic of power\".\nIt's pretty regrettable that the chief diplomat of a \"superpower\" let out such shameful, nasty remarks at the venue of the international conference dealing with global security issues.\nHowever, it is \"helpful\" that his bullshit once again made the world keenly realize that the \"rules-based international order\" trumpeted by the U.S. is a \"jungle law\" where the strong prey on the weak.\nCommenting on this, the Russian foreign minister said that \"the U.S. is coercing other countries into sharing its 'international system table', or else they will be on the 'menu'\". The Chinese newspaper Global Times reported that \"Washington's current official diplomatic rhetoric emphasizes the so-called 'rules-based international order,' but it is all used as tools to demand, restrain, and accuse others, or to cover up U.S. own hegemonic intentions\".\nAs recognized by public at home and abroad, it is the U.S. that cannot survive without preying on the weak, in view of its origination and existence mode.\nBuilt on the sea of blood of Indians, the U.S. staged over 114 big and small wars of aggression and more than 8 900 military interference actions for over 130 years until World War I, and expanded its territory by over ten times by annexing and subordinating other countries and nations.\nAfter World War II, the U.S. has grown corpulent through many wars and military interference actions in the DPRK, Vietnam, Iraq, Syria and other parts of the world and maintained its privileged position.\nEven in the present century when the unipolar world has been collapsing and a new, multi-polarized international order is being established, the U.S. is persistently pursuing its hegemonic and aggressive mode of existence and foreign policy, being obsessed with \"overconfidence in its own strength\", and is constantly breaking the security and stability of the world.\nThe present Middle East situation which has no sign of solution and goes bad to worse can be explained only by the logic of the animal instinct of the U.S.\nThe New York Times in an article titled \"Understanding the Middle East through the Animal Kingdom\" likened the U.S. going to become the \"king of the Middle East jungle\" to a lion and the Middle East countries to a \"parasitoid wasp\" or \"caterpillars\", and stressed the need for the U.S. to burn the whole jungle to kill the parasitoid wasp.\nHence, clearly proved are the true colors of the U.S. sacrificing the Middle East countries and the whole region for its ambition for domination.\nIn a nutshell, the U.S. is devouring others at the table, some countries and nations in the Middle East including Palestine are on the menu as the \"fish and meat\" and Israel is \"skillfully cooking\" to suit the taste of the U.S.\nThe outlook on the world based on the American-style jungle law and hegemonic foreign policy of the U.S. justifying aggression and war for existence can never be tolerated in the present era of human civilization.\nThe U.S. should no longer be allowed to devour the world at the table. -0-",

This sparked off more criticism and vigilance from the international community.\nAgainst this backdrop, the departed souls of the shrine, which have overheated the Japanese politicians with reinvasion fever, came to play the role of a \"mental education master\" for those responsible for realizing the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" under the command of the former SDF high-ranking officer.\nNamely, it is the reality of Japan that the departed souls of the \"imperial army\", who embarked on the road of aggression and plunder in the last century, are openly \"revived\" by the SDF contaminated by militarist poison - the modern-day \"imperial army\u201d.\nNo matter how hard Japan tries to defend such visits to the shrine calling them \"private visits made of their own free will\" under an avalanche of international protests and accusations, it can never cover up the true purpose of the visit to the shrine aimed at militarizing itself and realizing its revanchist ambition.\nWhether it is \"individual freedom\" or \"private visit\", their appearing at the shrine is an undisguised glorification of the unethical crimes committed by Japan and, moreover, danger is mounting as the reinvasion fanatics of the SDF are taking the lead in fanning up ultra-nationalism in Japanese society.\nJapan is ceaselessly expanding the SDF into an offensive force equipped with ultra-modern military hardware while embellishing its past crimes through the distortion of history and trumpeting about the alleged \"growing threat\" from neighboring countries.\nIt is the ambition of Japan for reinvasion that remains unchanged no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and it is self-evident that mankind will suffer another great calamity when it is overlooked.\nWhoever loves peace should be vigilant against the departed souls of the \"imperial army\" that are \"reviving\" in the dark corner of the shrine. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- Kang Jin Song, an international affairs analyst of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued the following article titled \"What is Washington's scheme to extend the sphere of alliance aimed at\":\nThe U.S. is now intensifying its scheme to expand and strengthen military blocs in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAs known, the U.S.-Britain-Australia tripartite defense authority talks on April 8 made public a joint statement on examining a proposal for promoting cooperation between AUKUS and Japan in the field of ultra-modern technology. And Biden confirmed Japan's participation in AUKUS at the U.S.-Japan summit held in Washington on April 10.\nIt means that the extension of AUKUS and the preferential participation of Japan have become formal.\nThe U.S. defends itself saying that cooperation between AUKUS and Japan is limited to the field related to eight core defense technologies, including artificial intelligence and cyber, and it's not aimed at increasing the number of AUKUS members, but the danger of Japan's participation in AUKUS is making the whole international community tense, not to mention the regional countries.\nIn September 2021, AUKUS was forged as a tripartite security cooperation body involving the United States, Britain and Australia. Since its founding, it has been called a nuclear mine planted in the waters of the Asia-Pacific as \"the Anglo-Saxon nuclear submarine alliance\" for seeking nuclear supremacy in the Asia-Pacific region by detouring the international nuclear non-proliferation system.\nJudging from the fact that the extension of AUKUS has become formal and the first candidate for its membership is Japan, a state of aggression and war criminal which tried to develop nuclear weapons during the Second World War and has covertly beefed up its capability for manufacturing nuclear weapons after the war, this poses a serious problem in terms of security environment of the whole world including the Asia-Pacific region.\nWhen the issue of extending AUKUS appeared on the table, Britain and Australia reportedly took a skeptical view, pointing out that Japan failed to fully protect sensitive information.\nAlthough Canada and New Zealand, members of \"Five Eyes\" - an information-sharing body of Anglo-Saxons - were potential candidates for \"AUKUS+\", Japan has been designated as a candidate member of AUKUS, which is attributable to the U.S. pressure and persistent persuasion, according to experts.\nClear is the intention of the U.S. that persists in involving Japan in AUKUS.\nIt is the sinister intention of the U.S. to make Japan, a vanquished country which revised the \"Pacifist Constitution\" and is making frantic moves to beef up the forces of aggression under the cloak of \"possessing counterattack capability\", obsessed by nationalism, a crewmember of a confrontation ship called AUKUS and put it at the outpost line of the anti-China pressure and push the nuclear minefield in the Asia-Pacific region closer to China.\nMost experts comment that the technical cooperation between AUKUS and Japan, promoted under the control of the U.S., will lead sooner or later to its full membership and to the additional admission of other potential candidate countries.\nThe Biden administration recently held a tripartite summit of the U.S., Japan and the Philippines in the wake of a U.S.-Japan summit to call for the strengthened security cooperation between Manila and Tokyo, and Canberra and Seoul. This is mainly aimed at building double and triple infrastructure for implementing the \"integrated deterrence strategy\" against China by ultimately putting together tools designed for achieving supremacy existing in the Asia-Pacific region in a \"latticed\" way.\nThe reality goes to prove once again that the \"competition accompanied by dialogue\" with China and the \"installation of a guard rail\" in bilateral relations, heard from U.S. public officials, are nothing but deceptive slogans and their thinking and practice are oriented to anti-China confrontation from A to Z.\nOwing to the establishment of a \"small group\" of the U.S. whose arch enemy is China and its ceaseless attempt to expand the group, the Asia-Pacific region, where opportunities and potentials for development are richer than any other region of the world, is turning into a theatre of muscle-flexing and a touch-and-go nuclear minefield, and the ensuing immediate and prospective security burden has been heavily placed on the regional and international community.\nThe peace camp in the region and the rest of the world should heighten vigilance against the reckless moves of Washington to frantically expand its alliance sphere without limits, targeting a certain state. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- Days ago, Prime Minister of Japan Kishida said at a meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives that \"he remains unchanged in his intention to revise the Constitution and that he would go on to make every effort to advance.\"\nIt goes without saying that the real aim sought by Japan in its desperate moves for revising the Constitution is to turn it into a \"country capable of fighting a war\" by revising the \"Pacifist Constitution\" for the worse.\nArticle 9 of the Constitution of Japan enforced since 1947 stipulates that Japan will give up for ever the war started by its state power and the threat of armed forces or the use of armed forces as a means for settling international disputes.\nThe former chief of the Legislation Bureau of the Japanese Cabinet said:\nArticle 9 stipulates that Japan will have no ground, naval and air forces and other war capabilities. In other words, Japan will possess self-defence force not an army.\nThere are two pillars that support the concept of \"self-defence\". One is that the Japan Self-Defence Forces can protect only their own country and not use armed forces abroad. Another one is the \"exclusive defense\" whose important aspect is that the SDF cannot have offensive weapons and it cannot have the capability to directly attack other countries' territories and territorial waters and airspace.\nIn this regard, it can be said that the Constitution has constrained to some extent the revival of Japanese militarism which had inflicted great damage on the peoples of Asian countries, advocating the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\"\nBut today, after a lapse of 77 years since the enforcement of the Constitution, Japan has completely removed the mask of \"peace\" which it had worn for form's sake.\nThe prime minister, referring to the existence of SDF set up as the revising item of the Constitution, stressed that \"it is an important work for showing the international community the will to defend the self-sustenance of the state and peace by putting an end to the theory of the SDF's violating of the Constitution, and making the members of the SDF fulfill their duties with pride\", and thus openly revealed where the purpose of the revision is.\nAs a matter of fact, the Japanese reactionaries have put spurs to turning Japan into a military giant after their defeat in the World War II behind the curtain of \"peace\" such as the \"Pacifist Constitution\", \"era of peace\", \"peaceful development\", \"proactive pacifism\" and \"achieving peace\".\nWith the revision of the \"Japan-U.S. Defence Cooperation Guidelines\" and the adoption of the \"security legislation\", they made it possible to expand the sphere of the SDF's activities, confined to Japan's vicinity, to the whole world and to exercise the \"right to collective self-defence\" under the pretext of military support to its allies.\nThe present Cabinet again revised the national security strategy, set by the Abe regime in 2013. It has approved the \"securing of the capability of attacking enemy base\" and is stepping up the preparation of long-range cruise missiles capable of directly attacking other countries' territories.\nAccording to the 2019-2023 trends in international arms transfers released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden on March 11, Japan purchased 29 fighters from the U.S. and ordered 400 long-range missiles for \"enemy base attack\", thus increasing its import of weapons by 155 percent over that in 2014-2018 to become the world's sixth-ranked importer of weapons.\nThe Japanese government included in the 2024 budget the defence fund, which is 16.9 percent increase over the last year to reach the highest record in history, and formally passed it on March 28.\nAlso, after discarding the principle of banning the export of lethal weapons, the Cabinet meeting decided to allow the export of fighters to the third country.\nIn the final analysis, \"the exclusive defense using defence capability only under attack, the abandonment of the possession of capability of attacking enemy base that means direct attack on other countries' territories, the principle of banning the export of weapons and the maintenance of defence capability that basically constrains defence costs to 1% of GDP\", touted by Japan in the past, have become a lip service.\nAgainst such a background, the Japanese prime minister is crying out for the revision of the Constitution. This is aimed at legalizing the militarization moves for reinvasion ambition in an institutional way by removing even such article of the Constitution which had remained an empty document.\nJapan, which suffered a bitter defeat while pursuing the militarist policy of overseas expansion, is rushing to turn itself into a militarist country and launch overseas expansion, oblivious of it. This is a foolish and reckless behavior of digging its own grave. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- Following is the full text of an article \"Provocation to regional peace and security can never be tolerated\" issued by a military commentator of the DPRK on Friday:\nOn May 16, the U.S. military sent F-22 stealth fighters deployed in Hawaii to the Korean peninsula and staged a \"simulated air battle\" with the Republic of Korea (ROK) for the first time.\nTwo F-22 stealth fighters of the U.S. air force and two F-35A stealth fighters of the ROK air force, involved in the drill, exchanged the roles of attack and defence with each other. The enemy media claim that the drill demonstrated the powerful \"deterrent\" to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\nWithout any explanation, we are well aware of why stealth fighters boasting of the \"world's strongest\" have been introduced.\nThe \"revisit\" of F-22 stealth fighters to the Korean peninsula only after seven months and their first \"simulated air battle\" are another clear proof of the hostile nature of the U.S. which has persistently encroached upon regional countries' rights to security while seeking the showdown of force with the DPRK.\nThe military gangsters of the ROK are now driving the military tension on the Korean peninsula into the extremity, keeping pace with their master's anti-DPRK confrontation scheme.\nIn May alone, the ROK staged the largest-ever drill, allegedly to cope with the DPRK's \"air infiltration\", by mobilizing the ground, naval and air forces, along with \"2024 simultaneous joint drill of military corps\" and \"joint drill for defending islands in the first half of the year\" near the border of the DPRK.\nIt also plans to stage a large-scale air drill involving more than 60 fighters such as F-35A and F-15K from May 17 to 24 and have a talk of special operation commanders with the U.S. at the end of this month so as to discuss \"beheading operation\".\nAll the facts remind us once again that the strengthened military alliance and deployment of strategic assets by the U.S. are the main root of further escalating the military tension and unpredictability in the region.\nThe deployment of F-22 will only precipitate the advent of a situation that the U.S. does not want to see, rather than its military effect.\nThe more frequent \"visit\" by unbidden guest across the ocean will further promote the epochal occasions that help step up the war readiness of the DPRK and, the accumulation of such occasions will be turned into a new strategic phase that the U.S. is afraid of and has to be frightened.\nIt will not be a wise behavior to neglect the bolstering of the force capable of neutralizing the military effect of the U.S. deployment of strategic assets and annihilating the source of provocation and the commanding forces in possible case of emergency, though it is hard to completely contain such deployment, to be continued in the future.\nThe military provocations of the U.S. and the ROK against the DPRK will never escape frustration due to the powerful practical counteraction of the DPRK for defending the national security and regional peace. -0-",

They have nothing to do with the genuine international efforts for the eradication of terrorism.\nIt is a universal truth that intensified \"anti-terrorist efforts\" of the U.S. give rise to the emergence of various terrorist groups and escalated vicious cycle of terrorist attacks and retaliation, far from defusing the danger of terrorism in different parts of the world.\nThat's why the U.S. slogan of \"anti-terrorism\" is now being slandered and rejected by the international community and used internationally as an official term for characterizing Washington's aggressive foreign policy.\nThe U.S. would be well advised to work hard to stop its junior ally in the Middle East in its reckless state-sponsored terrorism, rather than wasting its energy in its foolish act of branding other countries as \"terrorist states\" under the pretext of the \"efforts against terrorism\".\nIt is the consistent stand of the DPRK to resolutely oppose all forms of terrorism threatening international peace and stability.\nBut we remind the U.S. once again that we have neither intention nor interest in cooperation with the U.S. in its \"efforts against terrorism\" exclusively used as a tool for interference and aggression on other sovereign states.\nThe DPRK will continue taking necessary measures to disclose before the international community such interference and acts of aggression openly committed by the U.S. under the signboard of \"cooperation in combating terrorism\" and to thoroughly foil them. -0-",

It has frequently put into operation the \"Nuclear Consultative Group\" plotting to use nuclear weapons against the DPRK and is planning to stage actual nuclear operation exercises with the ROK in August.\nWhat should never be overlooked is the U.S. recent sub-critical nuclear test's impact on the military security situation of the Korean peninsula as it has added new tension to the military showdown among nuclear weapons states, fomenting the international nuclear arms race.\nTo cope with the strategic instability in the region and the rest of the world caused by the U.S. unilateral action, the DPRK cannot but reconsider the measures necessary for the improvement of the overall nuclear deterrence posture within the range of its vested sovereign right and possible options.\nThe DPRK will not tolerate the creation of strategic imbalance and security vacuum in the Korean peninsula, but firmly defend its security, rights and interests through powerful deterrent action against the evolving nuclear threat from the U.S. -0-",

Furthermore, regional peace and stability are exposed to serious threats due to the U.S. and its vassal countries' ceaseless war drills for aggression.

Therefore, it has neither justification nor authority to say this or that on the issue of the exercise of the legitimate right of a sovereign state.\nFor the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the launch of a military reconnaissance satellite is an inevitable undertaking for bolstering up the might of self-defence, and what is more, it is a matter directly related with its destiny whether to defend its independent right or not. And for the international community, it is a fundamental issue whether the spirit of sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs stipulated in the UN Charter is preserved or not.\nThe unfair behavior of the UNSC which left indelible stain on the trust and reputation of the UN organization will inevitably invite a tragic result of its own collapse.\nWe will never tolerate any moves of the hostile forces to violate the inviolable sphere under the exercise of sovereignty nor step back from having access to the space reconnaissance capability which should be done surely no matter what others may say. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- Kim Yo Jong, vice department director of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, issued the following press statement on Sunday.\nThe ROK connived at the provocative act of scattering the political agitation rubbish across the border of the DPRK again on June 6 and 7 despite our repeated warning against the intemperate psychological warfare of the scum who defected from the DPRK, thus aggravating the situation.\nIn the period between June 6 and 8, the despicable political agitation rubbish was discovered in Singye and Thosan counties of North Hwanghae Province, Jangphung County and Phanmun District of Kaesong Municipality, Kosan, Phyonggang and Cholwon counties of Kangwon Province and other areas of the DPRK near the border.\nAs already warned, the DPRK scattered 7.5 tons of waste paper with more than 1 400 balloons over the border of the ROK from the night of June 8 to the dawn of June 9.\nAs you will see, we have only scattered empty waste paper without any political agitation.\nIt is quite different from the provocative political agitation rubbish scattered by the scum of the ROK against the DPRK.\nOur minimum reaction is only the just and reflective reaction at the very low level.\nOur reaction was scheduled to end on June 9, but the situation has changed.\nThe reason was explained by the act of the ROK.\nThe loudspeaker broadcasting provocation started in the border area at last.\nThis is a prelude to a very dangerous situation.\nPoliticians of Seoul are trying hard to justify their stand with the only and strange deformed logic in the world that regulates and judges the \"freedom of expression\" and \"provocation\" in the windward direction. And they formalized their behavior just like a guilty filing the suit first that they have resumed the loudspeaker broadcasting smear campaign again against the DPRK's counteraction against their challengeable act, thus creating a new crisis.\nWe strongly denounce the despicable and childish behavior of the ROK and clarify our stand responding to it.\nIf the ROK simultaneously carries out the leaflet scattering and loudspeaker broadcasting provocation over the border, it will undoubtedly witness the new counteraction of the DPRK.\nThe ROK will suffer a bitter embarrassment of picking up waste paper without rest and it will be its daily work.\nI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once the dangerous act of bringing the further confrontation crisis and discipline itself. -0-",

The army dropped GBU-39, a GPS guided bomb, offered by the U.S.\nOn May 26, Israel dropped the same bomb on a refugee camp in Rafah, killing more than 40 civilians.\nThe whole world is vehemently censuring Israel for its massacre in disregard of international law and humanitarian principle.\nBut this time, too, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State patronized the horrible massacre, claiming that Israel did not cross the \"red line\" set by the U.S.\nAccording to his words, the \"red line\" set by Washington in connection with Israel's military operations means a \"large-scale operation in Rafah\" and it is the U.S. stand that it has not yet seen such large-scale operation.\nHis words mean that the death toll of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip that has reached nearly 40 000 is not enough for the U.S. and Israel but scarce.\nThey are the reckless remarks that can be made by only rare murderers who regard massacre as a common practice and pleasure. They revealed who is a backer for Israel running amuck in disregard of the strong denunciation by the international society and that the \"threat\" and \"warning\" against Israel touted by the U.S. before the world are no more than hypocritical sophism.\nWorld media say that the U.S. seems to make \"diplomatic efforts\" but is positively patronizing Israel's actions and driving the situation into a more dangerous phase by switching the \"blue light\" for the tragedy lasting in the Gaza Strip.\nEven at this moment, Israel's massacre is growing in the Gaza Strip under the patronage of the U.S.\nOn June 8, 274 Palestinians were mercilessly killed and nearly 700 wounded by the Israel's military attack on the mid Gaza Strip, but the U.S. \"red line\" and its rulers remain unchanged.\nThe reality goes to clearly prove that the \"red line\" set by the U.S. is not a \"check line\" for defending the international justice and humanitarianism but a \"banister\" for its stooges and murderers.\nThe world is spitting at the disgusting entity called the U.S., the chieftain of aggression and massacre which is only committing all sorts of vicious acts while styling itself the \"guardian of international order\" and \"apostle of justice and peace\". -0-",

This is a revelation of their extreme hostility towards the other party and an expression of their sinister intention to maintain the anti-Russia alliance on the basis of it.\nSuch gathering can never be a meeting for dialogue and peace and, evidently, it will be no more than a farce for confrontation and war expansion deceiving the world.\nRussia has already disclosed that the purpose of the Swiss conference is not to discuss the ways for settling the Ukrainian situation but to work out and present an unpardonable ultimatum to it. And it declared that it has no intention to take part in any event aimed at isolating and stifling itself rather than peace, strongly demanding that the agenda item be set right.\nMany countries have refused to attend this conference, claiming that all peace proposals should be discussed on a fair basis, under the condition that Russia and Ukraine recognize and each side takes part on an equal footing.\nEven media of the host country described the \"peace summit\" as a \"merrymaking of Western partners\", commenting that the conference would meet a miserable end as it does not take account of the position of the BRICS and other countries.\nIn the final analysis, the confab, prepared by the Zelenskiy puppet clique under the manipulation of the master with much effort, will bring together only groomsmen with \"bigoted fixed assets\" of NATO in the main that have not yet got rid of the yoke of \"military assistance for Ukraine\" at the U.S. beck and call. And it will show up the disgraceful looks of admitting their diplomatic failure and \"consoling\" themselves.\nIt is quite natural that the conspiratorial conference of those keen on inciting confrontation and war under the pretext of \"peace\" has come under criticism by the international community.\nThe U.S. and the West are now resorting to the formation of an international anti-Russia confrontation front together with military support to the Zelenskiy puppet clique in a bid to turn the Ukrainian war situation at any cost. But this is a self-destruction act of pricking their own eyes with their own hands and, moreover, it will only be a way far from \"peace\".\nIf the U.S. and the West continue such farce, the world will only watch the ruined shaman's rites.\nIf they truly want the solution of the Ukrainian crisis and global peace, it would be a beneficial and right behavior for them to make both sides sit at the negotiating table fairly with sincerity, not deception and hypocrisy. -0-",

This year, it is staging frantic drills for preemptive strike at the DPRK's nuclear facilities and major military bases, under the new \"operational plan 2022\", revealing its scheme for a nuclear war against the DPRK under the eyes of the world.\nNothing can compensate the mental damage suffered by the Korean people due to the U.S. ever-escalating nuclear threat.\nThe Korean people are strictly keeping tabs on all the criminal acts made by the U.S. against the DPRK that have lasted for decades, and looking forward to the moment when the U.S. will be made to pay dearly for all its crimes, the white paper says, stating:\n\"Blood for blood!\" -- this is the DPRK's norm related to irreconcilable compensation for the losses and its unshakable will to make a retaliatory punishment. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- The Ukrainian military gangsters committed an inhuman crime of killing civilians by attacking Sevastopol City of Russia with U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles tipped with cluster bombs on June 23.\nIt is not the first time for the puppet Zelenskiy clique to perpetrate such a terrorist attack against civilians.\nSince the outbreak of the Ukrainian crisis, the Kiev puppet regime has committed such crimes against innocent civilians hundreds of times by striking civilian facilities in Belgorod Region, Kursk Region and other parts of the Russian territory with lethal weapons supplied by the U.S. and other Western countries.\nWhat cannot be overlooked is the fact that the Zelenskiy puppet clique carried out the above-said bloody attack right after its American master lifted the restrictions on its use of U.S.-supplied weapons for the attack on the Russian territory.\nSome days ago, the national security adviser of the White House openly said that Kiev can use U.S.-supplied weapons to hit any Russian forces attacking from across the border, adding \"it is not about geography but about common sense.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Defense betrayed its true colors as an instigator of murder by asserting that Ukrainian forces can use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike any Russian forces not only in Kharkov Region near border but also in other parts of the Russian territory for their legitimate self-defense.\nThe U.S., which had come up with such hoodwinking restrictive conditions as \"for enabling Ukraine to defend itself\" and \"with a guarantee of not attacking the targets in the Russian territory\" when supplying weapons to the Zelenskiy puppet regime, \"allowed\" Ukraine to strike some parts of the Russian Territory earlier. This time the allowed scope of strike has been expanded to cover \"any target\" and the \"whole territory\" of Russia.\nThe U.S. has finally granted the Ukrainian puppets the right to unlimited use of U.S.-supplied weapons. This is little short of its official \"order of massacre\" to the puppets faithful to its strategy for hegemony and declaration of outright confrontation with Russia.\nThe recent atrocity, perpetrated with the bombs banned by international law and long-range weapons offered by the U.S., was an intentional \"murder by contract\" premeditated by the U.S. And this clearly proves that they have gone to extremes in their anti-Russia hysteria.\nRussia's stronger response for safeguarding the national interests and lives and security of its citizens is a just right to legitimate self-defence never to be refuted by anyone.\nThose who unhesitatingly issued an \"order to kill\" innocent civilians and the mad terrorists will be surely forced to pay dearly for the hideous crime.\nThe inhuman murderers and destroyers of peace can never escape stern punishment by history. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, June 30 (KCNA) -- The external policy office of the DPRK Foreign Ministry released the following press statement under the title \"We will continue to make important efforts to deter the acts of disturbing peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world\" on Sunday:\nThe U.S., Japan and ROK staged Freedom Edge, the first tripartite multi-domain joint military exercises in the waters near the DPRK from June 27 to 29.\nIn the past they staged many large and small joint military drills under various pretexts, but there had been no such a large-scale joint military drill dubbed with a special name.\nWe strongly denounce the U.S., Japan and ROK for their repeated reckless and provocative military muscle-flexing against the DPRK and other independent states in the region and once again seriously warn of the fatal consequences to be entailed by them.\nNow the international community unanimously comments that lurking behind the recent drill is the strategic design of the U.S. to escalate regional military tensions, exert pressure upon the Far East of Russia and lay siege to China.\nThe regular U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite joint military exercises clearly show that the U.S. strategy for world domination to encircle and contain independent and sovereign states and secure its military hegemony has already crossed the red-line and is bringing about a very negative change in the world security environment and geopolitical mechanical structure.\n\nFreedom Edge, typical expression of the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc\n\nThe danger of the first tripartite multi-domain joint military exercises between the U.S., Japan and the ROK lies not only in the fact that the armed forces of the three countries conducted drills in various operational spheres including the sea and air.\nThe gravity and danger of the situation lie in the fact that Freedom Edge is a product of the organization, systematization and actualization of the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc.\nThe U.S. is now claiming that the U.S.-Japan-ROK relations are just cooperative ones for strengthening regional stability and security and do not mean NATO of Asian version, but it is nothing but rhetoric to evade international criticism of the formation of an aggressive bloc.\nThe document, cooked up at the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite summit in August last year, specifies the immediate tripartite cooperation to cope with any threat faced by one of the three countries.\nThis is, in essence, reminiscent of NATO's principle of collective defense that it mobilizes its defense capabilities if a member country is attacked, regarding it as an attack on all.\nSince the Camp David confab, the U.S., Japan and the ROK have operated a real-time missile warning data sharing system under the pretext of coping with \"missile threat\" from someone to realize the integration in the field of military intelligence. They are also stepping up the integration of the military forces of the three countries by frequently staging joint military drills involving U.S. strategic assets.\nAs NATO stages annual joint military drills in all spheres including land, sea, air and cyberspace, the U.S., Japan and the ROK decided to regularly stage tripartite multi-domain joint military drills. This means that the U.S.-Japan-ROK relations have taken on the full-fledged appearance of Asian-version NATO.\nIn the final analysis, Freedom Edge served as an occasion for proving that the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc, the U.S. had been seeking to establish for decades, has become a present perfect form, not a continuous or future one.\n\nTrue intention in revitalization of exclusive military bloc\n\nAn official concerned of the U.S. Department of State recently asserted that Japan and the ROK are very good partners in coping with the threat from Russia.\nLurking behind this is the U.S. strategic scenario to use the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc as a three-horse carriage for carrying out its strategy for hegemony in not only Northeast Asia but also the rest of the world.\nAs already known, the ROK is a \"military colony\" which left OPECON (wartime operation control) in the hands of the U.S. and Japan is the largest overseas military base of the U.S, where more than 54 000 U.S. troops are deployed.\nThis hints that the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc is a war and aggression mechanism capable of standing in military confrontation against other countries at any time under the instruction and command of the U.S., unlike AUKUS, the security technology alliance of the U.S., Britain and Australia or the tripartite security cooperation between the U.S., Japan and the Philippines.\nIt is by no means fortuitous that the U.S. persistently tried to make the relations between NATO, the war machinery in Europe, and Japan and the ROK closely linked with each other.\nThe U.S., which had already pushed forward with the entry of Japan and the ROK into NATO 18 years ago, has got more frantic in realizing the organic bond between NATO and Japan and the ROK since it turned its strategic focus to the Asia-Pacific region.\nJapan and the ROK, which established partnerships with NATO and built channels of regular dialogue at the instigation of the U.S., are now taking part in the annual NATO summit and even in the NATO-led military exercises, further expanding their cooperation with NATO.\nAfter the outbreak of the Ukrainian crisis, Japan has been hell-bent on the moves to put pressure on Russia and the ROK has openly sought to provide the Nazi regime of Zelenskiy with lethal equipment. Such facts show that the close ties between NATO and the U.S.-Japan-ROK tripartite military bloc have reached a dangerous level.\nThe reality goes to prove that the \"inseparable relations\" between the security of Europe and the one of the Asia-Pacific region, touted by the U.S. and its vassal forces, are nothing but an excuse for realizing the political collusion and military integration between the NATO member states and pro-U.S. states in the Asia-Pacific region and encircling independent sovereign states.\n\nTo foil the alliance strategy of the U.S. is urgently needed to ensure international peace and stability\n\nThe Biden administration, in its \"Indo-Pacific Strategy Report\" and the \"National Security Strategy Report\", called on its allies in Asia and Europe to unite with each other to counter their strategic rivals.\nRecently, it has asserted that its alliance strategy is making the switch from a \"hub-and-spoke one\" of forming various bilateral alliances to a \"lattice-like one\" of forming several multi-lateral alliances cooperating with each other. It also claimed that the era of \"alliance protection\" is over and the era of \"alliance action\" has arrived.\nThis proves that the primary goal of the U.S. strategy for world domination is to form a global siege network to contain independent sovereign states which are opposed to its high-handed and arbitrary practices.\nSuch confrontational attempt of the U.S. is the root cause of fomenting political instability and military confrontation and triggering off bloody wars and touch-and-go security crises in different parts of the world.\nThe prevailing situation requires the independent sovereign states to steadily bolster up their self-defensive power to defend the security of the state and, at the same time, further strengthen mutual cooperation and concerted action so as to establish a structure of forces capable of effectively deterring the hostile forces' collective military intervention.\nThe U.S. and its vassal forces' expansion of the aggressive bloc and escalating military confrontation that wreck peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the region will be surely deterred by the powerful and coordinated counteraction of independent sovereign states.\nThe DPRK will never overlook the moves of the U.S. and its followers to strengthen the military bloc, which openly destroys the security environment on the Korean peninsula and gravely threatens global peace and stability, but firmly defend the sovereignty, security and interests of the state and peace in the region through offensive and overwhelming countermeasures. -0-",

And it will reportedly take about 30 years to discharge all nuclear-polluted water into the sea in this way.\nMankind is bound to face a horrible nuclear disaster due to Japan's shameless and irresponsible discharge of nuclear-polluted water.\nThis is not an empty talk but a reality that is approaching.\nThis is well evidenced by such facts giving rise to serious concern that the concentration of tritium (radioactive substance) in seawater near the Fukushima Atomic Power Plant has risen considerably and fishes have been killed in shoals since Japan started the discharge of nuclear-polluted water into the sea.\nNevertheless, Japan is insisting on the \"safe management\" and \"clearly treated water\". It is no more than an intolerable far-fetched sophism.\nFinally, all the countries and the whole regions in the world are completely exposed to the danger of global nuclear disaster unprecedented in history by the one state Japan nowadays.\nEven in the stark reality, Japan has persistently discharged the nuclear-polluted water into the sea for a long time in a bid to make its criminal moves \"normal activities\" by \"immunizing\" the international community and evade protest and denunciation focused on Japan.\nJapan, which invaded and occupied other countries and nations in the past and inflicted untold misfortune on them, is now bringing another grave disaster to mankind by unhesitatingly discharging a huge amount of dangerous nuclear-polluted water into the sea.\nIn fact, it is the stereotyped method of the cunning Japanese reactionaries to gradually pull down the \"wall\" of the international community just like a mouse gnawing a hole, blur the attention of the world people and then switch to a new phase of crimes when it is committing all sorts of crimes such as denying the past history and reviving militarism.\nThe international community should not tolerate criminal moves seriously threatening the human existence, sharply seeing through the crafty intention of Japan to \"dilute\" its crimes with its shameless sophism, the \"normal discharge of treated water\". -0-",

However, we cannot but refer to the fact that they fabricated and spread groundless rumors about the DPRK.\nUnexpectedly talking about the DPRK's \"threat\" over the Middle East situation fraught with a new danger, they asserted that tragedy of bloodshed in the region is being caused by someone's \"intervention\" or \"support\".\nThis clearly proves how desperately the U.S. has stuck to the smear campaign for tarnishing the image of the dignified DPRK and \"demonizing\" it.\nEveryone understands that the Middle East crisis was arisen and Israel has steadily committed massacre despite the denunciation by the world community as the U.S. has patronized and backed the Zionists and inspired their war hysteria.\nEven major Western media recently cited the figures and data to prove that Israel's large-scale indiscriminate military attacks on Gaza Strip are ascribable to the support of the U.S., which has unsparingly offered a large amount of munitions including high-explosive bombs and various kinds of missiles in every way.\nThis being a hard fact, American politicians have persistently intrigued against the DPRK, which is far from the Middle East. What is their purpose?\nIt is well-known to everyone that the U.S. has frequently raised such sophism as someone's \"threat\" and \"provocation\" in the international arena in a bid to slander the DPRK and justify its hegemonic moves.\nHowever, the power and position of the DPRK have not been weakened but remarkably increased, further making the U.S. feel uneasy. The world people unanimously recognize this development as a \"great failure of the U.S. anti-DPRK policy\".\nSo, the way out the U.S. finally found is to mislead the public opinion as if the daily-growing global danger is attributable to the DPRK by unreasonably linking the proxy wars, staged by itself in different parts of the world, with \"the DPRK's intervention and support\" and thus divert the focus of intensive international criticism and pressure to the latter.\nGiven the U.S. politicians deliberately link the cause of the escalating tension in the Middle East with the DPRK in a bid to tide over the worst crisis which makes the U.S. driven into a predicament, their nervous prostration is seemly developing into psychosis.\nBut the truth never changes.\nNo matter what silly jargons may be let out by any riff-raffs, the heinous crimes of the U.S., the axis of evil wrecking global peace and stability, and its crime-woven history can never be covered and it is more impossible to shift the blame onto others.\nThe DPRK's responsible mission to defend peace and stability in the region and the rest of the world can never be denied by anyone's effort to infamize the DPRK, and the cheap rumors fabricated by the U.S. to justify the \"bloody dinner\" only show the poor nature of the \"only superpower\" breathing its last. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 16 (KCNA) -- The programme for socialist construction in the new era of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea, which regards the great people-first principle as its sacred political ideals, and its outstanding and energetic guidance continue to give birth to the most scientific and revolutionary strategies for great regional development and bring them to brilliant fruition in the course of the comprehensive development of our dignified state.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Un, who worked out long ago a plan to improve the people\u2019s living standards as early as possible by making effective use of the sea in conformity with the natural and geographical features of the country with long coastlines, clearly indicated the orientation and ways for positively promoting and developing offshore fish-farming and aquaculture, and has wisely led the work to put it into practice.\nAmid the stirring reality, in which the struggle for implementing the historic Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy is being waged dynamically, he had already given the WPK Central Committee a special instruction to take direct charge of and push forward with the work for setting an example to be followed by all coastal cities and counties to promote their development in a characteristic way as suited to their specific conditions by making the most effective use of marine resources. True to his special instruction, Sinpho in South Hamgyong Province, a typical coastal city with a small area under cultivation compared to its population, was set as a model for this year and preparations have been made to this end.\nOn July 15,Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, together with senior officials of the Party and the government, visited the Phungo-dong area in Sinpho, South Hamgyong Province, and looked round the site of an offshore farm to be built, acquainting himself with the project plan. He then convened a consultative meeting of officials concerned on the spot.\nPresent there were Kim Tok Hun, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and premier of the Cabinet, Jo Yong Won, Ri Il Hwan, Kim Jae Ryong, Pak Thae Song and other secretaries of the WPK Central Committee, Pak Jong Gun, vice-premier of the Cabinet and chairman of the State Planning Commission, major commanding officers of the armed forces organs and relevant officials in the province and in the design sector.\nKim Jong Unpresided over the meeting.\nThe meeting discussed the issues arising in building the Sinpho City Offshore Farm into a new fine model for shallow-sea culture, generalizing it to bring about a substantial improvement in the economic development and the people\u2019s living standards in coastal cities and counties, and more dynamically pushing forward with the Party\u2019s regional development policy.\nReferring to the purpose of the convening of the meeting,Kim Jong Unanalyzed the economic potential of the seas and the importance and significance of their effective exploitation and use of their resources by the coastal cities and counties in successfully bringing about the epochal change in the 10-year revolution for the regional development which has entered the full-scale phase of its implementation, and set forth practical tasks and ways to this end.\nHe stressed that developing and making good use of their natural and economic resources in regions is very important to secure the independence and driving force of the regional economic development and, furthermore, to develop the country\u2019s economic potentials in a unified and development-oriented way.\nHe said that only when the regions create an atmosphere for balanced and competitive growth by building up the foundations for their independent and sustainable development in all the local areas, can the regional economy develop, and the more the regional economy develops, the greater the motive power of the overall economy will become, contributing to the strategic economic potential growth.\nThe consultative meeting heard the data on the economic profits and effectiveness of the Sinpho City Offshore Farm.\nKim Jong Unseriously analyzed the reasons why the Party\u2019s policy on developing the regional economy by making good use of the mountains in mountainous areas and the sea in the coastal regions has not been implemented so far. He stressed that the policies consistently maintained by the Party on narrowing the gaps between urban and rural areas in economic life can be implemented only when the state provides all the conditions and possibilities for the economic growth in regions in a responsible manner.\nSaying that if the scallop and kelp farming is conducted well in the waters off the Phungo-dong area the city of Sinpho, which is poor in economic potentials, can become the richest among the cities and counties in the country in three to four years, he expressed his determination to successfully build up the Sinpho City Offshore Farm into a model of aquaculture in the new century and present it to the people in the city as a gift.\nHe continued that it is the unique ties between the WPK and the army, their most sacred tradition and the decisive guarantee for victory in the revolution that when the Party leading the revolution plans any project, the army unconditionally carries it out, always holding it as an honourable historic mission. He entrusted the construction of the Sinpho City Offshore Farm to the Korean People\u2019s Army units.\nHe expressed expectation that the KPA, absolutely loyal to the Party\u2019s ideas, leadership and orders, would successfully build the model of offshore farming, to which the state attaches importance, and present it to the Party and the people as an outcome of its steadfast revolutionary stand and patriotic spirit.\nHe stressed the need for relevant units to responsibly carry out the tasks assigned to them as regards the construction of the Sinpho City Offshore Farm.\nHe instructed the Party Central Committee to set a creative example to be generalized and applied to other parts of the country by taking direct charge of the construction of the farm and powerfully and substantially pushing ahead with it. He also made sure that a division in charge of offshore farm construction was set up in the non-permanent committee for promoting the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy to exclusively supervise and guide the construction of aquaculture bases in other coastal cities and counties.\nPointing out that the layout of the farm, submitted by the design sector, was not worked out at the level appropriate to a model creation of the aquacultural industry in the new century, he stressed the need to conduct a sincere study in a more innovative manner and create a new one so as to make the construction of the farm another revolutionary stage of development in designing industrial facilities, and indicated the orientation of designing.\nLike all other undertakings, the development of aquaculture should be based on scientific guarantee and calculation along with proactive introduction of advanced technologies, he said, calling for giving priority to the selection of superior strains and paying primary attention to raising the scientific level to the maximum in the whole process, ranging from the management of the sea-farming ground to the preservation of ecological environment.\nThe consultative meeting took relevant measures after specifying practical tasks, including those for the senior city and county officials to comprehensively investigate the natural and geographical features and economic potentials of the regions under their charge and conduct a scrupulous study and organizational work to fully exploit them, to perfect the legal and institutional mechanisms to make the preferential measures for regional economic development prove effective, and to direct efforts to training core technicians and skilled workers in all cities and counties.\nAfter the meeting,Kim Jong Unwent round the waters for aquaculture by the farm.\nLearning about the shellfish farming under way on a trial basis, he said that the waters off the Phungo-dong area are favourable for aquaculture in various aspects, including water quality, depth and temperature. With his heart filled with deep emotion, he pictured in his mind the morrow of the Sinpho citizens who will enjoy happiness along with the wonderful change in their region.\nConvinced of the sure prospects of aquaculture and the possibility of its development, all the officials, who took part in the consultative meeting in the presence ofKim Jong Un, made a firm pledge to perform remarkable feats in the proudest and most worthwhile struggle by remaining true to their mission and duty in the struggle for placing the current new phase of regional development on a track of rapid promotion.\nThe consultative meeting will be recorded in history as a crucial watershed that set up an epochal milestone for the regional economic development of our own style and as today\u2019s \u201cChangsong Joint Conference\u201d that instilled into all the Party members and other people stronger confidence in the creation of a new life and happiness. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- The leadership of the great father, who always works with devotion through creative thinking to provide our people with the most civilized and happiest life, gave birth to another legendary tale of love in the Wonsan Kalma area, which is turning into a wonderful cultural tourist resort for the people.\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, gave field guidance over the construction of the Wonsan Kalma coastal tourist area on July 16.\nAccompanying him were Kim Tok Hun, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the WPK and premier of the Cabinet, and Jo Yong Won, Ri Il Hwan, Kim Jae Ryong, Pak Thae Song and other secretaries of the Central Committee of the WPK, Pak Jong Gun, vice-premier of the Cabinet and chairman of the State Planning Commission, major commanding officers of the armed forces organs, officials concerned of the Central Committee of the WPK, Kangwon Province and the design sector.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Uninitiated the construction of a characteristic and modern coastal tourist city of Korean style, of which we can be proud in the eyes of the world, and visited the construction site several times to indicate the orientation and ways for the successful development project and has guided the whole course of the project step by step. Thanks to his ceaseless devotion and wise leadership, magnificent and grand scenery is unfolding as a paradise of people in Myongsasimni, a scenic spot along the East Sea of Korea.\nAll the builders have turned out in high spirits with a firm determination to successfully complete the construction of the Wonsan Kalma coastal tourist area and fully demonstrate the validity of the people-first politics of the WPK. They are performing fresh miraculous feats day after day, true toKim Jong Un\u2019s noble intention to make devoted service for the well-being of the people, so as to attain without fail the construction goal set forth by the Party Central Committee.\nFeasting his eyes on the panoramic view of the vast tourist area stretching along a 4km coastline,Kim Jong Un, with a broad smile on his face, said that it was really beautiful and spectacular and he felt refreshed both in mind and body as he saw the scenery peculiar to the picturesque coastal area, and repeatedly expressed great satisfaction at the fact that it had taken on an impeccable appearance as a world-level coastal tourist city as planned.\nHe highly praised the builders for bringing about collective innovations in ensuring both the speed and quality of construction with a death-defying spirit, true to the Party Central Committee\u2019s plan to build the tourist resort as a monumental edifice of eternal value for the people.\nHe stressed the need to further expand the successes, not slackening the high spirit, as the project had entered its final stage, calling on the commanding officials to make a more exacting demand, the builders to display redoubled efforts and the construction inspection organs to enhance their sense of responsibility and role to the maximum.\nHe held a consultative meeting with officials accompanying him on the spot to discuss the practical matters for making full preparations for the operation of the tourist area according to a well-thought-out plan as the 19th Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party had decided to open the coastal tourist area by next May.\nStressing the importance of making good preparations for the operation of the tourist area, he said it is important to build a wonderful resort but the key issue is to ensure perfect services appropriate to its class. However fashionable its facilities are, it will lower its value as a tourist resort if the level of their services is low, he added.\nNoting that the capacity of the services and its feasibility should be scientifically examined to properly select service units, he called for making preparations for operation on a full scale from now on. And he specified the orientation for doing so and took a series of important measures.\nThe meeting discussed all the issues arising in the preparations for ensuring smooth operation of the tourist area, including those of ensuring the parking space as suited to the capacity of the tourist area, building an amusement park and a leisure activity area, building up the capacity for garbage and sewage treatment and training experts for all the categories of services.\nWonsan is a coastal city of natural and geographical beauty, and, in particular, Myongsasimni at the Kalma peninsula has long been known as a famous scenic spot, he said, adding that a marine park of national value to be known to the world as the best tourist resort of the country would be successfully built and Myongsasimni will win the fame as a pride of Wonsan and a 4km-long stretch of beach crowded with the people in the near future.\nStressing that tourism should be developed in a long-term manner on the basis of the experience gained in the construction of the coastal tourist area, he said that as our country is surrounded by sea on its eastern and western sides and has many scenic spots on its eastern coast, including Mt Kumgang, Mt Chilbo, Majon, Kumya, Riwon and Yombunjin, it is needed to steadily implement the policy of concentrating on making rational use of the abundant coastal resources of tourism. And he called for taking long-term steps to exploit in a unique manner the resources of coastal tourism for sports, leisure activities and marine sightseeing.\nAfter receiving the important instructions ofKim Jong Unthat clearly indicated the path for a new development in the country\u2019s tourism and advanced guidelines and ways for achieving comprehensive rejuvenation of Korean-style socialism and providing the people with a happier life, all the officials renewed their faith that the plans and determinations of the Party Central Committee are an immutable science and truth, and made a firm pledge to fulfil their responsibility and duty in the important and worthwhile struggle for creating improved civilization for the people, remaining faithful to his leadership. -0-",

Such situation indicates that the \"right to self-defense\" advocated by Israel is nothing but a \"right\" to massacre and plunder.\nThe seizure of land committed again in the hotbed of massacre goes to fully prove that the onslaught and vandalism, being perpetrated by Israel with the backing of the U.S. on pleas of an exercise of the \"right to self-defense\" and \"defensive action,\" constitute genocide to drive the Palestinians out of their home and eternally occupy their territory.\nThe \"right to self-defense\" is inappropriate to Israel as it is a hideous occupier and destroyer of regional stability that has expanded its territory through bloody aggression and massacre against Palestinians and other Arab peoples, while persistently hindering the legitimate foundation of the State of Palestine.\nIt is the height of double-standards and a tragedy of this world that the U.S. and the West, which often call for respecting nations' self-determination specified in the UN Charter and international law, have connived at the most outrageous territorial expansion being pursued by the Zionists.\nThis jungle-law-prevailing reality, in which one cannot but shed tears if his fist is not strong, requires us to fully cement our strength for self-defense, the foundation of our nation's existence and guarantee for its eternal development, to be invincible. -0-",

Now, it has gone the lengths of creating conditions for openly extending its tentacles of aggression to different parts of the world.\nWhat merits a serious attention is that the descendants of samurais are perpetrating the dispatch of troops to overseas in close combination with the dangerous joint military drills which can lead to a war of aggression any moment.\nThis year alone, the SDF has been hell bent on mastering war capabilities while staging a series of military drills with the U.S., Australia and other countries in waters around China, Hawaii and other parts of the world.\nAs regards the conclusion of the recent \"agreement\", Japan is scheming to make the SDF join on a full scale the joint military exercises between the U.S. and the Philippines which are being conducted every year around the Philippines.\nIt is the crafty intention of Japan to paralyze the international community's vigilance and concern over the militarists and create \"immunity\" by putting the dispatch of troops to overseas on a normal and regular footing through frequent overseas advance of the SDF and overseas military drills under various pretexts and then launch reinvasion at any cost.\nNow, whether the SDF with full war-conducting capabilities opts for overseas aggression or not is never a matter of possibility. It remains only a matter of time and place.\nThe international community should further heighten vigilance against the Japanese reactionaries' reinvasion moves as they inflicted huge damage on mankind in the last century. -0-",

portraits of brave tankmen heroes, who rushed first into the streets of Seoul to fly the national flag of the DPRK at the enemy's stronghold and mercilessly crushed the U.S. imperialists' \"ever-victorious\" divisions in Taejon, Taegu and Pusan could be seen in the column, symbolic of the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division.\nKim Jong Unheld his hand to encourage the columns, representing the first heroic generation of the DPRK and iron-willed guardsmen, who embodied boundless loyalty to the Party and the leader, mass heroism and matchless patriotic devotion.\nThe column, symbolic of the Guards 2nd Torpedo Boat Group which created a miracle of Jumunjin to be noteworthy in the world's history of naval battle, and the column, symbolic of the Guards Hero Kim Ji Sang 56th Interceptor Group that turned the \"air superiority\" of the U.S. imperialists into falling leaves, marched past the square filled with militant enthusiasm of the paraders and cheers of the spectators.\nThe spirit of death-defyingly implementing the order of the leader and making a breakthrough by running over scores of kilometers overnight to intercept the enemy's retreat and the self-blasting spirit of creating legends for the victorious war and the mettle of do-or-die struggle in confrontation with the formidable enemy incomparable in forces, were reflected at the colours and the portraits of heroes of the Guards Ri Hun 18th Infantry Regiment, Guards 10th Infantry Regiment, Guards 14th Infantry Regiment and Guards 86th Infantry Regiment.\nThe columns, embodying the brilliant military feats of the Guards 19th AA Artillery Regiment and Guards 23rd AA Artillery Regiment for defending the sky over Pyongyang as firm as a rock to safeguard the security of the Supreme Headquarters at the cost of their lives, marched past the square.\nThe columns, symbolic of the guards regiments, were followed by the column, symbolic of the Ministry of the Interior, that performed distinguished feats in smashing the attempts of the enemies and disclosing and purging a large number of spies and saboteurs on the fronts behind the enemy line and the home front, and the column, symbolic of the railway soldiers, who performed matchless feats in the transport of war supplies under the shower of bullets.\nAll the audience sent warm applause to the columns, further hardening their will to carry forward generation after generation the fighting spirit and indomitable soul of the heroic generation who created the history of great war victory.\nThen the columns of the three services of the heroic Korean People\u2019s Army, the defenders of the DPRK's government, who reliably defend the territory, waters and airspace of the country, entered the square in fine array, demonstrating the spirit to bring to conclusion the confrontation with the U.S. with the victory of their powerful country and the mightiness, modernity and bravery of the revolutionary armed forces.\nThe matchless army column, the personifiers of the great victory that has been invariably carried forward generation after generation without weathering though many years have passed, marched majestically, holding the colours of the Ministry of National Defence and the colours of large combined units.\nThe people's navy and the human-bullet flying corps also made their appearance.\nThe marchers of the three services were in high spirits to surely accomplish the great cause of justice for which they have prepared from one century to the next and from one generation to the next, holding fast to the ever-victorious treasured sword provided by the great Party Central Committee.\nThe square was filled with the pride of the people of having such an excellent army, which exalts the greatness of our Party and state and defends the people's happiness and rosy future in the fields of defending the sovereignty and the people and bringing about gigantic creation for the eternal prosperity of the country and the well-being of the people, true to the sacred slogan inscribed on the honourable colours, and with the deep gratitude to the Party Central Committee that has brought up such a powerful army.\nKim Jong Unextended warm militant salute to the guardsmen of the new generation who defend our ideas and cause death-defyingly at the vanguard of the revolution with their weapons fully loaded with the noble soul of the victorious wartime generation.\nAll the marchers shouted \"Hurrah!\" looking up toKim Jong Un, peerless patriot and heaven-sent, iron-willed brilliant commander, who has put the dignity and mightiness of socialist Korea on the highest level in history, handing over the tradition of great July 27 victory and the heroic spirit to posterity.\nAt the end of the march, an air squadron of the KPA Air Force flew in the sky above the square in a fan-shaped formation, adding to the joy of the war victory day.\nThe cheers of excitement reverberated far and wide, and fireworks were set off in the nocturnal sky of July.\nKim Jong Unwarmly waved back to the enthusiastically cheering masses, holding his hands high.\nThe ceremony of the commemorative march marked a significant occasion that powerfully demonstrated the firm will of the service personnel and people to glorify the era ofKim Jong Unas an era of fresh victory, glory and prosperity,

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 28 (KCNA) -- All the people and service personnel of the DPRK are grandly celebrating July 27, the day of great war victory recorded in the history of the country with immortal gold letters. They are extending sincere respect and warm congratulations to the defenders of the country in the 1950s, the most heroic generation and indomitable models that brought about the eternal glory of a powerful Korea.\nThe legendary feats the victorious wartime generation performed in saving the state and nation and their future, honourably defending peace and security of mankind and laying a solid foundation for building a rich country with a strong army, true to the ideology and guidance of the leader, are shining forever along with their noble name, and the matchless ideological and spiritual strength the brave warriors displayed in the war serves as an invincible might guaranteeing the steady and victorious advance of the cause of Juche.\nA meeting with the victorious wartime generation took place in Pyongyang, the capital city of the DPRK, on July 27, the 71st anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War with the sense of mission of the successors developing to firmly carry forward the great spirit of defending the country and the tradition of victory.\nThe Pyongyang Indoor Stadium, venue of the meeting, was filled with the pride of the victorious wartime generation that provided a precious asset to be handed down to posterity with ardent patriotism, loyalty and devotion and the ideological and spiritual heritage of the country and its people, and the warm respect of the younger generation for the revolutionary elders and the great pride of all the participants in being citizens of the victor nation.\nThe participants greeted with enthusiastic applause the war veterans and persons of wartime merits who were entering the venue of the meeting, wearing orders and medals shining with the proud feats of defeating the U.S. imperialists amid the playing of the light melody of the song \"July 27, Our Victory Day.\"\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was present at the meeting.\nThe respected ComradeKim Jong Unarrived at the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium and met war veterans who had worked for a long time at important posts of the Party, government and military, and exchanged warm greetings with them.\nWhenKim Jong Unappeared on the platform together with war veterans amid the playing of welcome music, all the participants broke into enthusiastic cheers of \"Hurrah!\" looking up toKim Jong Un, incarnation of the great dignity and strength of our invincible Party and powerful state and the banner of all victories and glory.\nChildren presented bouquets toKim Jong Unand war veterans.\nWaving back to the enthusiastic cheering crowds,Kim Jong Unextended warm congratulations to war veterans and all the civilians and service personnel across the country on the anniversary of victory.\nMembers of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and other senior officials of the Party, government and military were present there together with the participants in the celebrations of the 71st anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War, officials of the Party Central Committee, service personnel, officials and persons of merits of ministries, national agencies and Pyongyang Municipality, students of revolutionary schools, university students and schoolchildren.\nPresent there at invitation were diplomatic envoys and members of missions of foreign countries in Pyongyang.\nThe national anthem of the DPRK was played.\nRi Il Hwan, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, made a speech.\nOn the authorization ofKim Jong Unand the Party and the government, he warmly congratulated the war veterans, all the civilians and service personnel who greeted the V-Day with precious memories and great pride, and paid high tribute to the heroic soldiers and patriots who fell in the sacred war for defending the country.\nIt is the pride of our state and people and fortune of the younger generation that we have a significant meeting with creators and personifiers of the great history on the most precious holiday of the country, he said, adding that it is the honour of our generation to remember not only with pain but also with honour the dramatic era that turned the years of the most disastrous war into those of greatest victory.\nThanks to the honour of war victory, our state could have a remarkable strength that can be gained only by a victor nation and the Korean people could have acquired a valuable spiritual wealth which could not be obtained in ordinary days and which could not be learned by reading thousands of books, he said.\nIt is the proud tradition and characteristics of the Korean revolution to have created and defended the more than 70 years with the wartime spirit, he said, stressing that the defenders of the country in the 1950s who honourably safeguarded the glorious DPRK and provided the immortal heroic spirit are genuine patriots and models of ardent revolutionaries who would be praised and learned from for ever.\nHe said that today's grand festival is the peak of honour provided together by the generation who won victory in the war and the successors' generations who have bravely carried out the mission of defenders while turning the decades, which were no less arduous than the war, into the ones of legendary miracles and leaps forward in defence of the victory.\nThe spirit of the victorious wartime generation is the immortal soul that makes us demonstrate our dignity as an eternally powerful and great people, and we will win greater and more valuable victories by dynamically carrying it forward, he said, extending once again heartfelt thanks and best wishes to the war veterans who devoted their great soul to the ever-lasting history of victory and to the ever-victorious country.\nThe participants watched a video showing the feats and fighting spirit of the victorious wartime generation.\nThe war on the newly-built DPRK, a genuine people's country in the eastern part of the earth, was the enforcement of the U.S. imperialists' strategy for world domination aimed at enslaving our country, Asia and, furthermore, the whole of mankind. The confrontation with the arrogant imperialist ringleader with more than 100 years of history of aggressive war was an enormous challenge to our country with a history of less than two years after its founding.\nThe scenes showed that the Korean war forced by the U.S. imperialists was a war of unprecedented massacre, during which innocent people, nearly one-sixth of the total population of the DPRK at the time, were killed, outnumbering the fallen soldiers, and a great turmoil beyond human imagination in its brutality, atrocity and cruelty.\nThe war veterans and persons of wartime merits recalled the shock of 70-odd years ago, when all the people turned out in the do-or-die resistance for the future of a powerful country to change the course of history and define the direction of the course only with victories cherishing the solemn mission to prove that the DPRK was no longer a weak country and its people were never a weak people and the unbreakable self-respect.\nOther scenes showed that the rifles, which were used to kill more enemies with bayonets than bullets in battles where the difference in forces between the enemy and the DPRK could not be compared, were loaded with all the strength of miracles and indomitable spirit that brought about the great war victory.\nThe participants keenly realized the soul and spirit the victorious wartime generation had cherished, seeing the soldiers who carved on the rock a pledge of loyalty to the leader before death-defying, hand-to-hand fight, the soldiers who pressed the trigger of heavy machine-gun with the jaw after being wounded in the arms and legs and who blocked the enemy\u2019s pillboxes with their chests when hand grenades ran out, and the flags of the DPRK that were hoisted on the hills at the cost of blood and lives of the soldiers.\nThe historic scenes proved that the rear was also the front for the people who fought for victory in the war, with ardent love and bitter hatred, the day of victory was brought earlier and the precious tradition to be preserved and glorified forever was prepared thanks to the all-people movements including the movement of volunteering for military service on the front, emulation drive for increased production, drive for extra-haulage, women\u2019s movement to plough the fields, high-yield movement and the campaign for donating grains for the front.\nAll the participants realized once again that the wise leadership of PresidentKim Il Sung, who led the war with his outstanding military strategic ideas and tactics and brought up ordinary people into the masters of the heroic era with his warm love and trust unprecedented in history, and the unshakable faith of all the people and service personnel that they were sure to win as they were led by him were the key to winning victory in the war.\nThe scenes showing the might of the DPRK which defends its sovereignty, national interests and genuine peace with matchless self-defensive capability that can defeat any formidable enemy impressively taught all those who grew up in this powerful country free from the worries of the outbreak of war the truth that the history of winning the victory is great, but the history of succession which has defended and steadily carried it forward is still more ennobling.\nThe bouquets presented by the younger generation to the war veterans, who devoted themselves to the victory only and to the great power associated with the desire of their comrades-in-arms, were an expression of boundless reverence and ardent respect for them.\nAll the participants renewed their firm will to carry forward the glorious tradition of victory for ever by remaining loyal to the ideas and leadership of the great Party Central Committee which is cementing the military powerful strength for the future of the revolution and the nation.\nArmy Colonel Ri Un Ryong and Navy Lieutenant Commander Yu Kyong Song, officers of the Korean People's Army, made oath-taking speeches.\nExpressing their impression of seeing the fateful moments on the screen that the victorious wartime generation faced and the days of the fierce war, the speakers said that the matchless bravery and feats of many heroic soldiers who won the great victory, made them more keenly aware of the important mission of the defenders standing on the defence line of the country.\nThey said that our revolutionary armed forces have grown to be a personifier of extraordinary courage, strength and dignity, confident of victory, looking down at any formidable enemy, thanks to the revolutionary spirit and immortal feats of the victorious wartime generation, who turned the fateful years which could have ended in tragedy into the most proud ones.\nOut of surging hatred against the U.S. imperialists and the puppet ROK military gangsters hell-bent on provoking a nuclear war beyond the southern border of the DPRK even at this moment, they expressed their will to glorify with greater miracles and victories the feats of the guards units which struck the enemy with fear of ruin and brought about brilliant results in the battles and the legendary tale in the world history of naval battle, in which four torpedo boats sank a heavy cruiser of the U.S. Navy.\nThe speakers solemnly pledged beforeKim Jong Unand the Party and the state to become brave fighters in defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity and the territorial waters of the country, bearing in mind the lifetime intentions and requests of the war veterans, and to bolster up the thoroughgoing capability to cope with war and fighting efficiency in every way so as to make an overwhelming attack on the enemy anytime and without delay and annihilate them once Supreme CommanderKim Jong Ungives an order.\nWhen the meeting was over, enthusiastic cheers resounded in the venue again.\nKim Jong Unwished for long life in good health of all the war veterans, who have lived with struggle and devotion for the prosperity of their beloved country and happiness of their descendants and left beautiful traces in their life, and extended warm greetings to all the participants for a long time, hoping that they will all cherish the sacred dignity and honour of being citizens of the victor nation and firmly carry forward the soul of the victorious wartime generation.\nAll the participants were deeply moved by his world of noble revolutionary obligation and comradely love for the war veterans.\nThe meeting with the victorious wartime generation held on the occasion of the 71st anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War marked a significant occasion for redoubling the unshakable faith, courage, enthusiasm and fighting will of all the people and service personnel of the country to firmly carry forward the history and tradition of the sacred victory, glorify them for all ages and achieve without fail the great cause of building a rich country with a strong army as desired by the victorious wartime generation under the leadership of the great Party Central Committee. -0-",

This created a serious crisis, in which more than 5 000 inhabitants were isolated in the zones vulnerable to flooding in several island areas of the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County of North Phyongan Province.\nImmediately after the crisis occurred, leading officials of the Party, government and military were dispatched rapidly to the spot and helicopters of the Air Force of the KPA and various kinds of lifeboats of the Navy and a maritime guard formation of the Border Guards were promptly committed to the operation for rescuing the inhabitants according to the assignment directly given byKim Jong Un.\nAfter arriving at an air base, where the rescue operation was under way, by driving along flooded rough roads,Kim Jong Unlearned from commanding officers about the inhabitants in the flood-prone zones and the situation of the rescue operation.\nHe personally guided the operation, watching the whole course of the operation by ten-odd helicopters rescuing the inhabitants in the unfavourable weather conditions and emergency while making more than 20 rounds of consecutive shuttle flights.\nThe rescued people saw him waiting for them at the airport exposed to heavy rainstorm so unexpectedly and broke into cheers, shedding tears of deep gratitude and emotion.\nKim Jong Uninstructed the regional Party organizations and power organs to offer medical assistance to the rescued people by enlisting all possibilities lest they should feel any slight inconvenience.\nAs he talked with commanding officers and pilots of the air unit, he heard the situation in the afflicted areas and repeatedly requested them to rescue everyone without fail. He also saw to it that reconnaissance flights were reorganized several times even in the areas where the rescue operation was completed.\nHe encouraged the pilots who successfully rescued more than 4 200 people and shook hands with every one of them. He said with pleasure that the helicopters' rescue of so many people from the flooded areas in a little over a quarter of a day is an incredible miracle and a living example of air rescue operation and that it is a source of pride of our Party and state to have such excellent people\u2019s Air Force and it is his honour to be the supreme commander of such an army.\nHe highly appreciated the amazing feats performed in the rescue operation, saying that the characteristics of the people's Air Force faithful to its inherent mission were clearly demonstrated once again and that all the people across the country would feel grateful to the devoted efforts made by the Air Force and its spirit of unconditionally and death-defyingly serving the people.\nIn particular, the commander of a helicopter group fulfilled a difficult task for rescue flight in the van and possesses splendid capabilities and qualifications as a commanding officer, he said, adding delightedly that he has found out in a combat environment another excellent commanding officer to be emulated by the entire army. And he warmly encouraged him, patting him on the back.\nHe set forth the tasks and ways for concentrating all efforts on the rehabilitation and relief work to minimize the losses caused by the disaster and eradicate its aftermath as soon as possible and for taking timely measures aimed at preventing recurrence in the future.\nSaying that the flood damage in the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County is very serious, he stressed that leading officials and forces at all levels in the capital city and regions should be mobilized ideologically and promptly in the rehabilitation project while giving top priority to the protection of people's lives and property.\nHe said that primary attention should be paid to the medical prevention and treatment and the provision of living conditions for the flood victims to quickly stabilize their living and, in this regard, the Party and power organs in the relevant regions should supply relief goods including foods, medicines and daily necessities fully to the victims and console them, and that state support measures should be taken simultaneously.\nHe gave an instruction on convening an emergency meeting, saying that immediate steps should be taken to prevent further disasters as downpour is still expected in this region and full preparations made in advance to start taking permanent rehabilitation measures at once immediately after the danger of flooding has disappeared.\nSome areas in the counties on the shore of the Amnok River in North Phyongan, Jagang and Ryanggang provinces, including the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County, should be declared as special-level disaster emergency areas, and the Cabinet, commissions, ministries, national agencies, public security and armed forces organs and other institutions at all levels should  turn out in the damage prevention and rehabilitation campaign with all their forces and equipment so as to quickly remove the damage and restore the order of production and life to a normal level, he said, adding that important measures will be taken to this end.\nNoting that it is the most important and responsible task to take prior measures for preventing any accident rather than making haste for taking follow-up steps after its occurrence, he stressed the need for all regions and relevant sectors to remain alert on the highest level, so as to cope with the rainy season constantly bringing danger of flood damage, and pay the most primary attention to such undertakings for preventing the recurrence of flood damage as finding out and removing risk factors in advance, evacuating the inhabitants in a predictable and timely way and establishing a scientific flooding forecast and orderly information and control system.\nIt is important to take thoroughgoing rehabilitation measures, but I cannot but mention again the serious lesson taught by the present grave situation, he said, severely criticizing officials of relevant state organs and regions for their negligence of duty that caused the inevitable disastrous situation owing to their failure to take any flood prevention measures.\nNoting that he has already stressed more than once that proper emergency response measures should be taken to prevent damage by downpour, flooding and typhoon, he said:  I've already given a repeated warning to the irresponsible attitude to such serious practices on the part of officials. And the state repeatedly gave a precaution before the rainy season and the National Emergency Response Committee met on July 22, just a few days ago. But I can\u2019t understand why officials at major posts are not yet on red alert with regard to the natural disaster prevention work. Their indolence and expediency have reached a very serious level.\nWhenever they made a mistake, officials say they have realized its seriousness and will make redoubled efforts, but natural disasters still fail to be prevented, he said, adding:   This is due to the fact that, seized with defeatism in the struggle against natural disaster, they have not turned out with confidence in the disaster prevention work, hoping for the best while making themselves reliant entirely on the weather.    Consequently, though the National Emergency Response Committee has met on a regular basis and the emergency response committees were organized and have been operated in the capital city and provinces, they remain only in form, failing to play practical functions and roles.\nSaying that as was revealed this time, disaster prevention institutions were helpless as they had secured no proper essential rescue means to be used in case of disaster and so, the army was compelled to be seconded to the rescue operation, he seriously pointed out that what could not be overlooked any longer is just the irresponsible and non-militant attitude of the public security organ responsible for thoroughly defending the life and security of the people.\nThe county emergency disaster response commanding group and the Ministry of Public Security caused a temporary confusion in the rescue operation due to their failure in properly grasping even the number of the people in the areas vulnerable to the disaster and the number of the people rescued by the KPA was much larger than the number they had reported, he noted, saying this clearly showed what a serious phase their irresponsibility reached in direct proportion to the miraculous successes made by the KPA in rescuing the lives of more than 5 000 people.\nHe said that it is a quite ignorant and dishonest attitude to leave the lives and property of the precious people and the wealth of the country to the mercy of nature, as seen through the current flood damage in some parts of the country. And he stressed that it is quite possible to prevent any accident, if the disaster prevention work is seriously accepted as a matter of attitude and viewpoint on service toward the state and people and an important political and ideological matter, not merely a campaign against natural disaster, and measures are taken with high alertness to foresee even the worst situation.\nHe stated that, through this opportunity, cautions are given to all Party and power organs across the country so as to prevent all manner of damage by the disastrous abnormal weather. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, floods and heavy rains seriously and consecutively damaged some areas of the country, including North Phyongan and Jagang provinces.\nIn this regard, the 22nd emergency enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Eighth Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea was held in an afflicted area in the city of Sinuiju, North Phyongan Province, from July 29 to 30 to take urgent rehabilitation measures.\nPrior to the meeting, the respected ComradeKim Jong Uninspected the flooded areas, together with the premier of the Cabinet and secretaries of the WPK Central Committee.\nMany public buildings, facilities, roads and railways, including more than 4 100 houses and nearly 3 000 hectares of farmland, were flooded in the city of Sinuiju and Uiju County located on the lower reaches of the Amnok River.\nGoing round the areas deeply flooded beyond recognition,Kim Jong Unexpressed deep concern and his determination to take powerful state measures for the rehabilitation project in the shortest time to provide the people with a better cradle for life.\nAttending the meeting were members of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and members and alternate members of the Political Bureau.\nPresent as observers were senior officials in the fields related to rehabilitation, including electric-power, railways and communications fields and agriculture.\nKim Jong Unpresided over the meeting.\nNoting that the emergency enlarged meeting was convened to discuss damage prevention and rehabilitation measures as flooding simultaneously damaged several areas in recent days and its further danger is looming, he detailed the national and regional flood damage grasped so far.\nHe gave an appraisal of the relief measures and rehabilitation work taken and conducted by the relevant regions and institutions at different levels since the happening of the disaster, and analyzed the achievements and shortcomings.\nHe enumerated such evil practices revealed as the issue of the disaster danger, which could have been surely minimized in the early period but was amplified due to the failure of unified command despite the existence of the state guidance system related to emergency disaster response, and the issue of provinces, cities and counties, which could not but helplessly suffer from disaster for their chronic and indifferent attitude toward the disaster prevention work as they had not suffered great damage by flooding in the past. He then proposed to strictly punish those who severely neglected their responsible duties assigned by the Party and the state and thus caused even casualties, a practice that cannot be pardoned.\nSaying that the people are observing the meeting even at this moment as they trust the Party, he underscored the need to take all measures in a powerful and detailed manner to remove the aftermath as soon as possible, mindful of the expectation of the people and the important mission before them, and set forth important tasks and ways to this end.\nHe stressed that measures should be taken to urgently supply the reserve materials for emergency disaster relief to quickly stabilize the living of the people in the flood-hit areas, and that the Cabinet and relevant ministries and national agencies should be actively mobilized in this work.\nHe detailed the practical issues arising in the rehabilitation work, including those of correctly surveying the damage and losses in provinces and, on this basis, making a scientific calculation of the scale of rehabilitation projects, manpower and budget, of ensuring promptness in the projects by enlisting the design forces in the capital city and regional areas without delay and giving precedence to designing and of dispatching construction workforce as soon as possible and fully supplying and transporting materials.\nSaying that it is necessary to thoroughly prevent additional damage caused by the disastrous climate in the future, he called on the meteorological forecast sector to make weather forecast in a responsible manner and on every sector and unit to make thoroughgoing preparations for preventing damage with the highest degree of awareness and, in particular, to make sure that no casualty is caused.\nCalling for dynamically pushing ahead with the work of rapidly stockpiling essential equipment and apparatuses for rescue operation at a time when disaster occurs, he made public important measures for it.\nCalling upon the participants in the meeting including members of the Political Bureau to visit the tents where the flood victims of Uiju County are staying temporarily and thus feel the sense of their heavy responsibility while directly seeing their living conditions, console and encourage them, make a deep study of detailed measures for rehabilitation, listening to their candid opinions, and submit the measures to the Political Bureau, he concluded the first-day sitting.\nThe second-day sitting took place on July 30.\nThe meeting studied the draft decision on the immediate repair of the flood damage.\nThe decision \u201cOn rapidly repairing the flood damage in North Phyongan and Jagang provinces,\u201d which additionally reflected the results of study and opinions of the participants, was adopted with unanimous approval at the meeting.\nThe meeting appointed Ri Hi Yong, former first deputy department director of the Organizational Leadership Department of the WPK Central Committee, as chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, Pak Song Chol, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, as chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK and Pang Tu Sop, first deputy department director of the Department of Political Leadership over Military Affairs of the WPK Central Committee, as minister of Public Security.\nConcluding the meeting,Kim Jong Unsaid that we have faced a crisis several times, but each time we have been brave and offensive in the face of it and always worked only miracles and there is nothing impossible as long as there are the leadership of the Party and the army and people that are faithful to the Party. He ardently called for stoutly turning out in the face of this crisis and making miraculous achievements.\nThe 22nd emergency enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Eighth Central Committee of the WPK will shine long in the history of the WPK as an epochal occasion for putting the buildup of the disaster prevention and management capability of the country onto a new high and as an important political event that clearly demonstrated once again the sacred mission and people-oriented character of the WPK which gives top and absolute priority to the interests of the people and makes selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 3 (KCNA) -- The people\u2019s Air Force of the Korean People\u2019s Army perfectly carried out the special order of the Central Military Commission of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea by rapidly flying to the flooded areas in the northwestern part of North Phyongan Province and rescuing over 4 200 precious lives. The legendary feats of the courageous red flying corps of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea that displayed an indomitable fighting spirit are stirring the whole country.\nKim Jong Un, general secretary of the WPK and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, on August 2 paid a congratulatory visit to the helicopter unit of the Air Force of the KPA that performed a miracle of air rescue operation.\nLining up at the unit\u2019s apron with national flag fluttering were the helicopters which were dispatched to the flooded areas to save the people.\nAll the officers and men, waiting for the moment of greeting the respected ComradeKim Jong Unat their unit, were filled with boundless reverence for the Supreme Commander, who, with the warmest love for the people and the will to save their lives at any cost, organized and commanded the rescue operation in a dangerous flooded area and brought about an unprecedented miracle and bestowed all laurels on them.\nWhenKim Jong Unarrived, the service personnel of the Air Force burst into cheers of \"Hurrah!\" as a token of their highest tribute and glory to the great brilliant commander.\nHe received a salute from the commander of the KPA Air Force.\nHe paid tribute to the colours of the KPA Air Force and of the unit.\nHe was greeted by leading commanding officers of the Air Force and commanding officers of the unit.\nResponding to the enthusiastic cheers, he extended warm greetings to the reliable soldiers who glorified the name of the people\u2019s Air Force with their brilliant military feats in the emergency rescue operation for implementing the special order of the WPK Central Military Commission.\nHe was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee, first vice-president of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, Pak Jong Chon, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, Kang Sun Nam, minister of National Defence of the DPRK, and Ri Yong Gil, chief of the General Staff of the KPA.\nThere took place a ceremony of awarding order to the helicopter unit that performed distinguished military feats in the sacred struggle for defending the people.\nThe national anthem of the DPRK was played.\nKim Jong Unmade a rallying speech.\nIn the speech, he said:\nI wanted to proudly boast about the pilots of the helicopter unit who performed matchless feats in protecting our God-like people without an equal in the world, and out of this desire I have come to the unit on the way back from the site of repairing the flood damage. Holding a grand commendation ceremony and making the whole army learn from them and the world know about them represent the extent of the feats of the pilots and the height of the appreciation of the Party and the country.\nNo casualties occurred in the Sinuiju area, which suffered the greatest flood damage caused by the record heavy rainfall and the rapid increase in water inflow in the basin of the Amnok River. This fact cannot be expressed otherwise than a miracle. The service personnel of the Air Force demonstrated matchless combat efficiency in achieving feats by giving full play to their bravery in the face of the then dangerous weather conditions and to their expertise and perfectness in carrying out their successive missions.\nThey left another precious and honourable record that would go down in the history of distinguished military feats of our heroic army. I extend heartfelt thanks to all the service personnel of the Air Force, who protected the God-like people and firmly defended the people\u2019s trust in the Party and the government by piloting their aircraft through rain clouds and heavy rains at the risk of their lives.\nI am also thankful that all the pilots are safe although one helicopter crash-landed in an operation area on its mission.\nI also extend warm thanks to the combatants of the sharpshooter brigade of the Navy, maritime guard formation of the Border Guards and the General Reconnaissance Bureau who were involved in the rescue operation.\nThe pilots of the helicopter unit proved what the soldiers and the well-prepared unit, to be emulated by the entire army, should be like through its capability for fighting a war at the battlefield where their lives were at stake, not on a training ground for judging capability.\nSeeing the organized, professional and unhesitating combat actions of all the soldiers, who immediately launched into a rescue campaign in the unfamiliar flood-hit areas in bad weather conditions at night true to the order of the Party Central Committee, my heart grew warmer as I felt that I found a genuine model unit.\nI would like to speak highly specially of the combat spirit and deep ideological and moral world of the unit commander, who is able to stand in the vanguard before shouting an order. Our Party needs such a field commanding officer of abilities and action required by modern warfare. I was deeply moved to see him carrying out the successive and repeated missions of reconnaissance, rescue and search without showing any sign of getting tired that day. It is a real miracle to have saved more than 4 200 people within a few hours with the helicopters, totalling more than 5 000 people when those, rescued by other units which carried out their rescue mission on the water, are included.\nThese are undying feats to be described with the words heroic and miraculous as they are a success greater than shooting down 10, nay, 100 enemy aircraft and feats to be glorified and handed down in history for the character of the operation as a campaign for defending the people.\nAlthough the wonders done by heaven are constantly changing and no milestone exists in the vast open sky, our Air Force\u2019s skyway is the only one indicated by the Party and revolution. This is why the feats performed by our pilots are so honourable. I am of the belief that the pilots and all other officers and men of this unit will as ever firmly defend the cause of the Party and reliably safeguard the security of the airspace sovereignty of our state and the well-being of its people with ardent patriotism and loyalty and heroic fighting spirit.\nThe service personnel should raise more fiercely the flames of the revolution in training just as they were brave, skilled and unhesitating in the struggle for defending the people, so as to annihilate the enemy.\nThe enemy\u2019s rubbish media are spreading a false rumour that the number of casualties in our flood-hit areas is expected to be over 1 000 or 1 500 and that several helicopters are believed to have fallen on the rescue mission. Clear is the sinister purpose of those in Seoul obsessed about such a smear campaign.\nSaying that the enemy remain unchanged, he bitterly censured the inveterate habits and despicable nature of the ROK scum keen on a vicious smear campaign to disparage the DPRK and tarnish its image at any cost, and continued:\nWe will neither give up national defence for disaster relief or for the people's living nor pay less attention to their living for national defence.\nReferring to the future orientation of development of the Air Force,Kim Jong Unaffirmed that the people's Air Force would make a great contribution to ensuring national security and regional peace and stability, adding:\nThe people are our God. We should care about the inconvenience of the flood victims who are at evacuation areas even at this moment when boiling heat still rages. We should speed up the rehabilitation as much as possible. We should make the whole country brim with the communist trait of one for all and all for one the harder the times are, and in particular, our army should show utmost filial devotion to the people as befit their sons and daughters.\nExpressing his thanks again to the unit for having performed sacred feats in the campaign for defending the people, he ardently wished the heroic people's Air Force victory and glory.\nWhen his speech was over, the service personnel of the Air Force burst into thunderous cheers again.\nAll the participants expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Supreme Commander, who put them forward, who had only remained faithful to the mission of the sacred people's Air Force, as a source of pride of the Party and the state, and renewed their iron will to be always thoroughgoing and courageous in defending the sovereignty of the country and ensuring the safety and well-being of the people true to the slogan inscribed in their glorious colours.\nChoe Ryong Hae read out the decrees of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly of the DPRK on awarding the Order of Freedom and Independence 1st Class to the helicopter unit of the KPA Air Force and the title of DPRK Hero to its commander who had led the unit in the campaign for defending the people to achieve brilliant feats.\nKim Jong Unpersonally conferred the orders.\nHe affixed the Order of Freedom and Independence 1st Class to the colours of the unit.\nHe awarded the title of DPRK Hero, Gold Star Medal and Order of National Flag 1st Class to the commander of the unit.\nThe citation of the Supreme Commander of the armed forces of the DPRK was conferred on 47 pilots and flight engineers.\nThe officers and men of the Air Force broke into enthusiastic cheers, looking up with deep gratitude to the great brilliant commander who decorated their feats performed on the road of military service with the gold star while respectfully calling them the army of lifeguards of the Party Central Committee and the first death-defying corps in defending the revolution and the people.\nThe unit commander made an oath-taking speech on behalf of his unit.\nThe self-sacrificing devotion of the great father, who regards our people as part of his flesh and blood that can never be lost, constituted an inexhaustible driving force that encouraged us to brave downpour and strong wind and a key to the fighting efficiency that enabled us to bring about an unprecedented miracle in air rescue operation, he said, and made the following pledge: The red hawks of the brave Air Force of the DPRK will as ever fly along the route of loyalty and requital without even 0.001mm of deviation, cherishing the trust of the Supreme Commander and the Party Central Committee as their whole life.\nThe venue of the awards ceremony was filled with the militant enthusiasm of the participants to fully demonstrate the spiritual qualities and mettle of the people's Air Force in the struggle to death-defyingly defend the well-being, rights and interests of the state and the people by giving fuller play to the steadfast revolutionary faith, patriotic spirit and spirit of devoted service with which they have supported the ideas and cause of the great Party Central Committee in the vanguard.\nThere took place a march-past of the guard of honour of the KPA Air Force.\nKim Jong Unposed for a photo with the pilots, who performed distinguished feats in the operation for defending the people, with the glorious colours at the centre.\nHe repeatedly said with high appreciation that the steadfast officers and men of the Air Force, who share the steps of strenuous efforts and mind with the Supreme Commander to serve the people with absolute commitment, cherishing the outlook on the revolution and life that there is no greater happiness than the pride of sharing intention, will and practice with him, are a source of the highest pride of our Party and people, expressing expectation and belief that the pilots will steadily carry on the present honour with more brilliant feats.\nThe firm pledge of the air fighters to display the mettle of the WPK's red phoenix braving any flames and storm, cherishing the great love and trust shown byKim Jong Unas the mainstay of their faith, resounded far and wide in the sky of August along with the loud shouts of \"Kim Jong Un\" and \"Death-defying defence\".\nThat eveningKim Jong Unhosted a reception in congratulation of the unit\u2019s officers and men who received the orders of honour.\nLeading officials of the Party, government and military attended the reception and warmly congratulated the winners.\nThe reception was filled with the feelings of kinship and trust between the great brilliant commander and his bodyguards.\nKim Jong Un's congratulatory visit to the helicopter unit will be brilliantly recorded in the history of army building as an event filled with warm love and encouragement that put on the eminence of the times the brilliant tradition and ever-victorious militant spirit of the people's Air Force, which has always flied along the route of absolute loyalty and heroic military service to defend the country and the people, and powerfully inspired it to perform continuous feats. -0-",

It can never be justified in any case and with anything.\nThe Russian government said that any attempt of the Western countries to confiscate Russian assets will be branded as stealing and will not escape punishment and no matter what rhetoric they may make, theft will remain theft, too.\nThe unbiased world public censured it as a clear illegal one, expressing serious concern over the fact that it would be a bad precedent for the disposal of state assets in dispute and an act of harming international financial stability.\nBut the U.S. and the West are advertising their rare robbery as a well-intended act for \"peace and security\", claiming that emergency measures are necessary in the extraordinary period and there is no greater symbol than making Ukraine and the whole of Europe safer with the funds of the Kremlin.\nIs the robbery for \"peace and security\" being allowed to do?\nThere is no pretext for justifying robbery and theft in the world.\nIt is an open fact that the U.S. and the West were seeking Russia's overseas assets to fill up their financial resources which run out for the long-term crisis in Ukraine.\nAs recently disclosed by the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. national debt has reached the worst phase beyond 35 trillion US dollars and the other Western countries, too, are not placed in a position to look after others due to their poor economic situation.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine spends more than 136 million US dollars every day and more than 4 billion US dollars every month for military expenditure.\nThe Russian assets frozen by the West, which cannot but make every effort for running the Russian war machine, are no more than a lump of oily meat.\nIn order to calm down the internal differences in view and international legality at any cost, the U.S. and the West have thrust themselves into the robbery in group while competitively faking up legal frameworks for allowing the seizure of the assets of a sovereign state.\nThe EU decided to allocate 90 percent of the earnings of the frozen assets of the Central Bank of Russia to the supply of military assistance to Ukraine and the remaining 10 percent to other items. This clearly shows its real intention to prolong the bloody war and slaughter on the European Continent, not to end the war.\nNo matter how hard the U.S. and its followers may describe their act as one for \"peace in Ukraine\" and \"security in Europe\", they cannot conceal their atrocious nature turned into a worldwide gangster group. And it will be another evidence of proving their predatory, arrogant and shameless nature.\nThe world people are stunned by the ignorant and rude robbery of the U.S. and the West which is not the first and the last.\nThe U.S. and the West will have to pay dearly for their plunder, irrespective of international law, market rules, enemy or ally. -0-",

It gets frantic in the development of new-type nuclear weapons, conducting high-powered bomb tests and sub-critical nuclear tests.\nAfter cooking up the \"nuclear operation guidelines\" with the ROK, the U.S. committed itself to providing Japan with \"extended deterrence\" including nuclear weapons, inveigling its vassal countries into the framework of a nuclear alliance.\nAll facts go to prove that the U.S. nuclear-based scheme to subdue the independent and sovereign states in the Korean peninsula, the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world is evolving in an extremely grave direction.\nOne side's such unilateral escalation of nuclear threat and provocative modification of nuclear posture stress the need for the other side to bolster up the self-defensive nuclear deterrence and perfect the preparations for a nuclear war.\nThe U.S. reckless nuclear confrontation racket makes clearer the DPRK's choice and goal for defending the security interests of the state and the regional peace and stability.\nIt is the constitutional duty of the nuclear forces of the DPRK to deter nuclear attacks of any forms and scales to be schemed or attempted by the hostile states, and to defend the national sovereignty and territorial integrity from present and future uncertain security environment.\nIf hostile states opt for making themselves and the world less secure, the DPRK is ready to take the most necessary measures to ensure its sovereignty and security interests and regional and global peace and stability.\nThe U.S. and its followers are bound to bear the whole responsibility for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their reckless option. -0-",

Rather, it is a strength of the absolute loyalty these workers are displaying in unconditionally and perfectly carrying out the Party's decisions and plans from the standpoint that doing so is their ennobling duty.\nAbsolute, unconditional and perfect implementation is our munitions industry workers' invariable raison d'etre, lifeline and unique quality.\nTrue to the orders of the Party Central Military Commission, the workers, scientists and officials in the munitions industry have made strenuous efforts to manufacture hundreds of cutting-edge military hardware, thereby fulfilling the strategic plan for developing our state's war deterrent to the highest level possible. By doing so, they have instilled an overwhelming sense of dignity and honour in all the patriotic people of this country, and inspired them with renewed confidence in final victory. I highly appreciate them and offer positive encouragement to them in their efforts for more proud successes.\nComrades,\nAs the relationship of the U.S.-led alliance is, in terms of its nature and character, evolving into a nuclear-based military bloc, the military security environment surrounding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is facing drastic changes, both strategically and structurally.\nThis highlights the fact that our state has no reason to rest content with its current level of war deterrent.\nTo look back on the past five years, we can see that the concept of nuclear has been associated with every military action targeting the DPRK taken by the United States, and now its vassal states have grown reckless enough to share its nukes.\nThis situation demands that we keep accelerating the development of our Republic's armed forces for maintaining their supremacy, and also of the self-reliant defence industry that provides solid support to this end.\nGenuine peace can be guaranteed only by the build-up of immense strength.\nNegotiations and confrontation are among our options, but we must be more thoroughly prepared to cope with the latter--this is the review and conclusion we have derived from the 30-odd years of dealing with the United States, and it is the keynote of our consistent policy towards the United States.\nThe fact that the United States and the groups of its top-class stooges are overstepping the mark in their outrageous military manoeuvres provides evidence for the justice of our cause, and this compels us to bolster up our self-defensive military capability more perfectly and rapidly. This will inevitably hasten the failure, shame and destruction on the part of the enemy.\nThe United States we are now confronting is by no means an administration that remains in power for a tenure of some years, but a hostile state that our descendants, too, will have to counter generation after generation. This fact testifies to the inevitability of the steady improvement of our defence capability.\nWe should possess the capability to cope on our own initiative with new, potential dangers to our security, as well as the various imminent threats by the United States. This is a crucial task for providing a long-term guarantee for defending the sovereignty, security, interests and territorial integrity of our state.\nAt present, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has built up its national system of nuclear forces, with which to promptly counter any type of threatening actions by the nuclear-armed enemy states, and we have made steady efforts to make the nuclear forces fully ready for action.\nHowever, witnessing the rapidly-changing global security environment and the reckless expansion of the U.S.-led military bloc system, we have come to a conclusion that the nuclear forces of our state and its nuclear posture should be more thoroughgoing and perfect, and we feel its necessity every day and every minute.\nOur mightiness is not what it is now, but it lies in our relentless pursuit of mightiness.\nStagnation in military supremacy is just the beginning of inferiority in defence capability.\nWe must never forget that if we rest content with the present level of supremacy that has taken so much cost for us to reach, we should pay more later.\nClear is our standpoint in coping with the U.S. moves to aggravate the situation.\nIf it continues attempting to jeopardize the security of the region in disregard of our repeated warnings, we will make the United States acutely aware that there will be fatal consequences for its own security.\nI make it clear once again: Whether engaged in negotiations or confrontation, possessing a great military strength is an obligation and right a sovereign state must never neglect or budge on at any moment.\nUnless an end is put to the nuclear threat against us, and as long as there exist the imperialist forces that resort to nukes as a means of their tyranny, there will never be a moment\u2019s halt or a breathing space on our journey for the consolidation of our nuclear war deterrent.\nOur strength will continue to evolve, and our military supremacy will deny its limits forever.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea will resolutely face both imminent and potential challenges by attaining a more refined and improved posture of its nuclear forces as soon as possible to contain any nuclear threats and defend itself from them.\nGiven the fact that the United States and its vassal forces have been tightening the screw on the DPRK by resorting to military means,Kim Jong Unsaid, it has been an indisputable option for the DPRK to make sustained efforts to increase its defence capability.\nHe went on:\nBuilding up the nuclear war deterrent and developing it to the highest level possible is the best option for effectively confronting the nuclear blackmail and multi-faceted isolation schemes by the United States and for earmarking a larger investment for economic development and improvement of the people's living standards--this is the principled standpoint we have consistently maintained over the last ten or so years since we proclaimed the new line of promoting the country's economic construction and building up its nuclear forces simultaneously, and its validity and viability have been clearly proved through practice.\nWe should always bear this in mind, and work hard to achieve the goals of the five-year strategy for defence development advanced by the eighth-term Central Committee of the Party, uncompromisingly and faultlessly, thoroughly and completely.\nThe munitions industry must never compromise on its absolute mission that increased production of military hardware provides a sure guarantee for safeguarding the country's sovereignty and enhancing its prestige; it should work hard to achieve greater and prouder successes in attaining the Party's objectives for modernizing the defence industry and in carrying out its task of producing weapons of the Juche type.\nThe army units, to which the new-type weapon system is to be transferred, should master the new system as early as possible, actively organize and conduct training in a real-war atmosphere to operate it so effectively as to maximize its efficiency in battle, and maintain a prompt and proper operational posture. In this way, they can creditably implement their military duties to deter war and take the initiative.\nWhat our proud new missile units will receive today is not merely the new weapons.\nLike all other weapons of ours, these embody our people's firm will to put an end to the threats of aggression against our Republic, as well as their spirit of self-respect to make theirs an invincible country that no force will dare to attack and their desire to develop it into a powerful nation.\nWe will continue to develop and produce more powerful and sophisticated military hardware of our own style and deploy them for action, thus ensuring that the People's Army keeps gaining in strength over time.\nThe Party Central Committee will always accompany and properly lead our munitions industry workers, both faithful and dependable, on this responsible and important journey.\nComrades,\nLet us bear in mind once again that absolute and matchless self-defence capability provides a sure guarantee for independence, justice and peace.\nEver-developing, inexhaustible\u00a0strength is fundamental to our eternal victory, genuine peace, happiness and safety.\nLet us all strive undauntedly and achieve constant transformations and innovative successes for the independent development of our great state and a peaceful and prosperous new life of our people. -0-",

Britain and other Western countries joined in it.\nBut the Middle East resistance forces, enraged by Israel\u2019s brutal massacres and the U.S. and the West patronizing them, have conducted fierce military activities, which are growing stronger day by day.\nIt is the Yemen resistance forces that have emerged as the main rival driving the U.S. and the West into a defensive in the waters of the Red Sea.\nThe resistance forces conducted military attacks to shoot down six MQ-9 Reapers, the air combat drones the U.S. is pride of, in six months and the myth of the U.S. \"mightiness\" has been completely thrown into the Red Sea.\nThey are still pressurizing the U.S. and the West, saying that their military attack will continue to increase unless Israel stops the mass killing.\nIn this regard, the international community is calling the U.S. and the Western military operations of the \"defender of prosperity\" in the waters of the Red Sea, the hopeless ones like a \"whack-a-mole game\".\nEven the U.S. military experts deplored the U.S. navy which has faced the most persistent and difficult battle after the Second World War.\nThe commanding officer of a destroyer of the U.S. forces expressed his extreme fears, saying people do not know that we are carrying out the missions under deadly threat and if we make one mistake of judgment, we are hit by missile.\nThe frightened guys are frequently attacking each other.\nIn February an escort ship of Germany, which claimed to be the latest warship, misjudged the U.S. navy's drone as enemy and launched two interceptor missiles. But they failed to reach their target and dropped into the sea. This incident clearly showed the confusion caused by fear among armed interventionists in the waters of the Red Sea and the weakness of their \u201cultra-modern equipment\u201d.\nIt is by no means accidental that the international community comments that the huge naval forces of the U.S. and the West which are not seizing a naval route against resistance forces, not a regular army, are below the level.\nBut it is one reason to consider.\nAnother reason is that the will of the anti-U.S. resistance in the Middle East not to tolerate any more U.S. acts of imprudently thrusting in its head and going arbitrary in the region is resulting in overcoming the \"superiority of force\".\nThe reality goes to prove that the Western forces headed by the U.S. that are engrossed in war and massacre in different parts of the world are bound hands and feet by the anti-U.S. sacred war in the regions for defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity. -0-",

exciting moment, when we will make a historic change after breaking with the notion that the fury of nature is unavoidable, awaits our Party members.\nIt is the mission and revolutionary duty of the Party members to always find themselves earlier than others in the most difficult and seriously damaged areas to inject vitality into the advancing ranks by playing a bold vanguard role, he stressed.\nThere is nothing impossible for us to do as the heroic example of the air force fighters, who performed miraculous feats by rescuing the people in danger to death-defyingly implement the

of absolutely supporting the plan and determination of the Party Central Committee and putting them into perfect practice, the decision of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee will be surely brought to fruition resulting in great changes.\nA message of pledge to the respected ComradeKim Jong Unwas adopted.\nAll the commanding officers and men of the regiment made a solemn vow to

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 6 (KCNA) -- The waters of the Red Sea is becoming a \"maze\" for the U.S. and Western armed interventionists who have thronged there.\nAfter the outbreak of the Middle East crisis, the U.S. has deployed nuclear carrier and other strategic assets in the waters of the Red Sea to destroy the Middle East resistance forces against the Israeli Zionists and, at the same time, played a role of \"protector\" supporting the human killing of its servant. Britain and other Western countries joined in it.\nBut the Middle East resistance forces, enraged by Israel\u2019s brutal massacres and the U.S. and the West patronizing them, have conducted fierce military activities, which are growing stronger day by day.\nIt is the Yemen resistance forces that have emerged as the main rival driving the U.S. and the West into a defensive in the waters of the Red Sea.\nThe resistance forces conducted military attacks to shoot down six MQ-9 Reapers, the air combat drones the U.S. is pride of, in six months and the myth of the U.S. \"mightiness\" has been completely thrown into the Red Sea.\nThey are still pressurizing the U.S. and the West, saying that their military attack will continue to increase unless Israel stops the mass killing.\nIn this regard, the international community is calling the U.S. and the Western military operations of the \"defender of prosperity\" in the waters of the Red Sea, the hopeless ones like a \"whack-a-mole game\".\nEven the U.S. military experts deplored the U.S. navy which has faced the most persistent and difficult battle after the Second World War.\nThe commanding officer of a destroyer of the U.S. forces expressed his extreme fears, saying people do not know that we are carrying out the missions under deadly threat and if we make one mistake of judgment, we are hit by missile.\nThe frightened guys are frequently attacking each other.\nIn February an escort ship of Germany, which claimed to be the latest warship, misjudged the U.S. navy's drone as enemy and launched two interceptor missiles. But they failed to reach their target and dropped into the sea. This incident clearly showed the confusion caused by fear among armed interventionists in the waters of the Red Sea and the weakness of their \u201cultra-modern equipment\u201d.\nIt is by no means accidental that the international community comments that the huge naval forces of the U.S. and the West which are not seizing a naval route against resistance forces, not a regular army, are below the level.\nBut it is one reason to consider.\nAnother reason is that the will of the anti-U.S. resistance in the Middle East not to tolerate any more U.S. acts of imprudently thrusting in its head and going arbitrary in the region is resulting in overcoming the \"superiority of force\".\nThe reality goes to prove that the Western forces headed by the U.S. that are engrossed in war and massacre in different parts of the world are bound hands and feet by the anti-U.S. sacred war in the regions for defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity. -0-",

Such explosive volunteering enthusiasm can never be found in any other countries. I would like to speak to the world proudly that our country has such great young people.\nOur young people have preserved and glorified their true appearance with enthusiasm, wisdom and practice by overcoming the obstacles on the road of their advance by dint of struggle. Such deeds of theirs originate from their strong faith to share their destiny with socialism forever and are a manifestation of their beautiful outlook on life, with which they find the honour and worth of their life in their ardent love for the country and dedication to the Party and the revolution.\nIt is the fact to be really proud of that a large contingent of such laudable and stalwart young people, who regard the hardship of the country and the people\u2019s misfortune as their own pains, fervently support the determination of the Party Central Committee and deem it their revolutionary task, adds strength to the Party and the country, powerfully demonstrating the stout mettle of the Korean youth with their hearts burning with fervent enthusiasm, he said, and extended warm thanks to the commanding officers and members of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade and all other young people and students.\nHe also offered his warm greetings to the parents, who sent their dear sons and daughters to the grand construction sites without hesitation, and to the organizations and officials of the Socialist Patriotic Youth League at all levels that have inspired many young people to volunteer through an earnest appeal.\nHe then continued:\nThe enterprising spirit and soaring mettle peculiar to the youth and their ever-growing vigour serve as an incomparably precious and powerful engine for our Party and people in attaining high goals and tiding over impending difficulties.

spirit and matchless charging spirit of the young vanguard of Juche Korea are further developing into the most leading and revolutionary advance and heroic struggle to be praised forever along with

of Korea, designated the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade to undertake the rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in the flood-hit areas in Sinuiju City and Uiju County of North Phyongan Province.\nVowing to perform again miraculous and heroic feats through a gigantic brave offensive, glorifying the dignity and honor of the Korean youth, in response to the call ofKim Jong Un, many

the socialist patriotic youth, letting them stand in the vanguard of the struggle for the rosy future of a prospering power, and with their fervent will to live up to his such trust.\nWhen he arrived, all the participants burst into stormy cheers of \"Hurrah!\"\nAll the participants paid the highest tribute and glory to the great leader who has brought up the young people to be the most vigorous unit of society that adds fresh strength to the country and creates new changes and to be the successors of the revolution who remain faithful to the cause of the WPK.\nHe extended militant greetings

struggle, eagerly waged by them for over ten years, how the spirit of loyalty and patriotism bequeathed by the martyrs is inherited.\nNoting that the flood damage restoration work, to be launched in

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- The following is the full text of the respected ComradeKim Jong Un's important speech before flood victims:\nDear inhabitants from the flood-stricken area,\nHow do you do, everyone?\nI think you must be experiencing much inconvenience and difficulty in this evacuation area after leaving your houses owing to the unexpected natural disaster.\nSome days ago I saw your circumstances and had emergency measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the state on the flood-stricken spot, but I could hardly get to work at the thought about the flood victims.\nOf course, I have received reports several times a day that all the victims are leading a more or less stabilized life, but I could not be relieved from worry for a moment.\nI have come here again to acquaint myself with the situation in greater detail on the spot, reassign some tasks for the rehabilitation project and take additional measures of national importance, which would be helpful to you.\nSeveral days have passed since you faced an abnormal living environment in temporary shelters after experiencing a great unexpected disaster, and I have felt ill at ease as I have failed to help you greatly in spite of the willingness to do something somehow.\nThough the whole country has turned out to sincerely help you, for the present I cannot but feel anxious and impatient as I am unable to remove all the inconveniences you are experiencing in the damp tents and poorly-furnished public facilities.\nNevertheless, as I see all of you in good health, showing no sign of inconvenience, I feel much relieved and greatly encouraged.\nOur Party and government should have given you strength and energy, but they are gaining strength from your appearance.\nYou have always trusted and relied on our Party and government, and in these days of harsh trials, too, you place such an absolute and unconditional trust on them. I feel very grateful for and proud of it.\nAnd I realize more keenly what should I do more and how for these laudable people, who steadfastly follow our Party devoting their pure loyalty and a sense of obligation throughout their life.\nWhat I would like to mention first here is that the Central Committee of our Party and the government of our Republic will always share with you your pains caused by the disaster.\nThe people are the foundation and pillars of our Party and state and the starting point and focus of their all activities.\nGoing closer to the people to share their feelings the harder the times are is the mode of existence and activities inherent to our Party.\nThe place where the leadership of our state should find itself at a time when the people suffered disaster like this is the disaster-stricken area and rehabilitation project site.\nExtending once again profound consolation to you, I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to outline the immediate measures our Party and government will take to promote the living of the flood victims and repair the damage.\nAll work of the Party and the state are now concentrated on the rehabilitation campaign here.\nNot only here but also some areas in Jagang and Ryanggang provinces in the basin of the Amnok River suffered damage.\nIn order to finish the campaign in the shortest period possible on the highest level, the Party and the government have decided to make a readjustment of even some of the construction projects of national importance and commit colossal human and material resources to the campaign.\nFor us today, nothing is more important and urgent than to stabilize the living of the flood victims and take permanent safety measures to prevent any recurrence of flooding.\nAs a preliminary to the enforcement of effective measures for fully restoring the flood victims\u2019 living conditions as soon as possible and removing the aftermath of the natural calamity, a comprehensive and detailed investigation about the damage is ongoing, and the relevant sector is striving hard to draw up a scientific plan for the restoration project.\nA more than 130 000-strong construction workforce comprising service personnel of the People\u2019s Army and young people is being committed for the restoration work here in North Phyongan Province alone.\nAt the national level, the Central Committee on Measures for Repairing the Damage was organized and has commenced its work, to be followed by provincial on-site headquarters for the restoration work; and the transportation of necessary materials has already been switched over to an emergency system.\nOur objective in displaying such daring spirit, organizing work at lightning speed and seeking its unfailing implementation is to transform your dear island villages and the northwestern part of the country beyond recognition.\nComrades,\nThe whole country is all out for the restoration work, but given the extent of damage, it will take at least two or three months to stabilize the flood victims\u2019 living by building new houses and repairing the existing ones.\nWhat the Party and the government should give top priority to in this period is to take good care of their living as much as possible.\nRecently, I am holding consultations every day with leading officials of the relevant institutions over the necessary measures to be adopted to this end.\nIt is indispensable to set up a well-regulated system for the distribution of newspapers and other publications, supply a TV set to each family and install one in every public place, so that the afflicted residents can keep abreast of the Party\u2019s intentions, and to direct close attention to ensuring them a good meal.\nThe biggest bottleneck in the flood-stricken areas is the living and teaching for students and other children.\nCurrently, some leading officials within our government, for their lack of experience and qualifications, are making a point of the restoration work in total disregard of educating and caring for students and other children.\nNeedless to say, children will find it quite inconvenient to live in tents or others\u2019 houses until the completion of the restoration work, and, in particular, this will have a serious impact on their education.\nAlso, measures for medical care are not going beyond the supply of medicines, and there is not yet a specific and realistic plan for medical services.\nWith regard to this, I criticized the officials concerned at yesterday\u2019s consultative meeting with the relevant departments of the Party Central Committee.\nSo, we are going to put in place an emergency system, whereby during the restoration work the students and all other children of the afflicted families in North Phyongan, Jagang and Ryanggang provinces shall stay in Pyongyang and be provided with a safe and comfortable environment for care and education, entirely at state expense.\nNursing, edification and education of students and other children are the most important of all state affairs never to be abandoned even if the sky may fall in.\nSo, the state is going to take full responsibility for this work during the rehabilitation campaign period.\nAnd state-backed care benefits will be offered in Pyongyang to the elderly and sick persons, honoured disabled ex-soldiers and nursing mothers before new houses are built in the flood-stricken areas.\nAccording to a rough estimate,\u00a0among the families of flood victims preschoolers number 2 198, students 4 384, the elderly 4 524, the sick and the honoured disabled ex-soldiers 265, and nursing mothers 4 096.\nThen, the number of flood victims who will be brought to Pyongyang will total over 15 400.\nWith a view to giving such a state emergency assistance, the Party Central Committee will organize a command team and ensure that services for them are offered at the April 25 Hostel and the military parade training base in Pyongyang.\nIt will provide temporary learning spaces for students and other children and organize interim mobile educational teams, comprising teachers from primary and middle schools and preschool educational institutions in Pyongyang. They will give education without letup to the students and other children after their summer vacation is over.\nIt will also ensure that staple and subsidiary foods, daily necessities and medicines are fully supplied, and mobile service and medical teams are organized with competent members from the important service units and hospitals in Pyongyang so as to direct all efforts to ensuring the living conditions of flood victims according to the state\u2019s special measures.\nThere might be some mothers who are reluctant to be separated from their little children for several months, and there might be some persons who are unwilling to leave for some reasons, I think.\nAs there may be their personal reasons, I will leave it to their intentions and decisions.\nHowever, this was organized to do even one more thing helpful to the flood victims suffering in the unfamiliar areas and minimize their inconveniences, you may rest assured of me, I think.\nAs it is the top priority work of the state, the Party and the government will take full responsibility for caring with utmost sincerity the health and living of the flood victims coming to Pyongyang as their parents and children would do, and make special and devoted efforts lest all of them feel an iota of gloom.\nIt is another problem facing the families evacuated from the areas, which are undergoing rehabilitation, that they have no proper places to keep their family property even if they manage to get them out of water.\nThe flood victims do not show any signs of it, but they might feel great anxiety.\nSo for the convenience of the evacuated families during the construction of new houses, we should offer them places where they can keep their household belongings safely.\nThis will also be good for the families to be enjoying protection and care in Pyongyang.\nComrades,\nIt is necessary for us to impress on our mind once again that the current rehabilitation project is not simply an undertaking for our own but also a serious struggle against the enemy.\nAt present, the enemy, misusing the occasion when we have suffered damage, is continuing to make foolish attempts to tarnish the image of our state.\nIt is important to inform Party organizations and working people\u2019s organizations at all levels, various networks of education and the people of these facts and thus make them have a correct understanding of the ROK scum bordering on us.\nThe rubbish ROK\u2019s media are desperately slandering all the socialist benefits and measures taken by our Party and government for the flood victims and also the communist traits displayed throughout the society, abusing them as a means of achieving some sort of internal unity and a type of demonstration. They are also fabricating such false information, in their frantic manoeuvres to slander our government and system, that the missing persons in the afflicted areas exceed 1 000 in number and that its intelligence authorities found out that several helicopters had fallen on rescue mission.\nWorse still, they are spreading a baseless rumour that the V-day celebrations took place in Pyongyang on the 27th of last month when loss of life occurred in the flood-hit areas.\nBecause the rumour is in wide circulation in the ROK society that its government is always late in coping with all sorts of accidents that happened there and such is an everyday occurrence in the country, they seem to weave absurd sophistry that slanders and slights us in an attempt to coax their citizens and stir up world public sentiments.\nWhen I visited the helicopter unit that rescued you, I gave full account of the rescue operation, including the crash-landing by one helicopter during the operation, and expressed my gratitude that there had been no casualties in the turmoil.\nThe enemy even went so far as to say that I reacted personally to the report fabricated by their media because there were heavy casualties and I intended to cover it up.\nWhat is their dogged insistence on making you, safe and sound like this, missing or dead? It is an open and shut case.\nThis is a smear campaign and a grave provocation against our state as well as an insult to you.\nI have reason and feel it necessary to say this about the media of the dirty, rubbish country.\nThere is no need for us to make separate materials for education. It is because these clear facts are actual and educational materials good enough to clearly bring home to the people how filthy the enemy clan is, what ancient and old-fashioned way they resort to for fabrication and political smear campaign to tarnish the image of our state, what their ulterior motives are and why we call the enemy the enemy and scum.\nNo country in the world has such media which does nothing but to invent groundless and exaggerated lies.\nWhat we must clearly realize is that the enemy is what we see them now.\nReferring to these actual facts, the whole country should have a correct understanding of the enemy and cultivate a correct feeling against them.\nOur enemy is an unchangeable enemy.\nWe should make the current opportunity, which helps us to have a correct understanding of what our enemy is, an opportunity of having a correct stand towards the enemy.\nToday, present here are leading officials of Party organizations and government organs of North Phyongan Province, as well as officials of Uiju County.\nI would like to take this opportunity to dwell on the tasks of regional Party organizations and government organs for stabilizing the living of flood victims and repairing the damage in the disaster-stricken areas.\nThe masters of relevant areas should play their proper role in the effort to stabilize the living of the flood victims at the earliest possible date.\nAs you have witnessed, many flood victims in different areas including North Phyongan and Jagang provinces are living outdoors in the violent heat and sultry weather.\nOf course, we built houses for the people without fail in the past, however many of them were destroyed, and now the flood victims in the afflicted areas are living optimistically, placing their trust in our Party.\nEven so, local Party organizations and government organs should never make light of the fact that there are people who have been left homeless and are living in tents.\nThey should ensure that food, non-staple foodstuffs and fuel indispensable for their living are supplied regularly without running short of them, and take strong measures to supply them with daily necessities.\nProvinces, cities and counties should promote the flood victims\u2019 living by providing them in a responsible manner with the food and other materials in need with those in reserve and promptly supplying them with relief materials of the state.\nThey should supply the flood victims with all daily necessities, ranging from bedding, sanitation goods to such small articles as scissors, needles and threads.\nThey should direct close attention to the supply of drinking water.\nWater is one of the basic essentials for people\u2019s living, and drinking water is badly needed in the flood-hit areas where there are scarce sources of it owing to pollution caused by flood damage.\nParty organizations and power organs in the relevant areas should do away with a temporary attitude, and take effective steps for supplying enough drinking water to places where the flood victims live.\nPublic health and epidemic prevention are the most vulnerable sectors in the afflicted areas.\nWherever the flood victims have been evacuated, it is necessary, by taking their number into account, to properly install bathrooms, public toilets, garbage dumps and drain pipes in conformity with hygienic standards and effectively maintain them, so as to eliminate the sources of outbreak of epidemic diseases.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should commit all medical resources available in the areas to taking good care of the victims\u2019 health in a responsible manner, supply them with Koryo and other medicines to the utmost, and conduct an epidemic prevention campaign in an intensive way.\nThey should be proactive in organizing and conducting the rehabilitation project to restore the production and living order in the flood-hit areas to the normal level.\nThey should strictly conduct a safety test of the afflicted dwelling houses and public buildings, and on the basis of this, promptly launch the rehabilitation project.\nA key factor in this regard is to check such details as whether the buildings, which were submerged, have not undergone structural changes and whether their foundations are firm enough, and thoroughgoing measures should be adopted for preventing second damage due to the collapse of those buildings.\nAnother important factor is to distinguish what should be newly built from what are in need of repair, introduce a scientific order of priority and plans for the restoration work, and give priority to the construction and repair of houses so that the flood victims can move into them as soon as possible.\nIn addition, the socio-economic life in the afflicted areas should be put back on a normal track at the earliest possible date by vigorously pushing forward the rehabilitation of the damaged public buildings and industrial facilities including schools, kindergartens, hospitals, factories and enterprises.\nThe designing and construction of dams in the afflicted areas should be done in a scientific way, based on a comprehensive and detailed survey of the local physiographical conditions and embankments. In particular, it is important in designing the dams to make an accurate estimate of the conditions at the time of the highest level of water, and, wherever necessary, to install flood-blocking structures.\nAs things stand at the moment, our regions are unilaterally vulnerable to the rising level of water flowing into the Amnok River. This time we should decisively remove this chronic vulnerability, thus totally eliminating the source of risk of flood wreaking havoc on Uiju County and the city of Sinuiju on the lower reaches of the river.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should adopt prompt measures for restoring the major elements of infrastructure in the afflicted areas, such as roads, railways, communications and power grids.\nEnsuring free traffic flow is a pressing task, since it is a prerequisite for the transport of manpower, equipment and materials to the rehabilitation sites and for the residents\u2019 free economic activities. So, it is urgent to open the roads and railways in cooperation with the People\u2019s Army units that have been seconded to the rehabilitation project. Efforts should also be focused on restoring communications and the power grids to meet the needs of the local residents and the rehabilitation project for communication and electricity at the earliest possible date.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should work in a responsible manner to recover damage that has been done to the agricultural sector.\nThis time not a few hectares of crop fields were inundated; they should not give up or feel disheartened, but make redoubled efforts to prevent the spread of damage.\nThey should learn a lesson from the fact that the key aspect of damage is the most of the crop fields being submerged. They should identify the weak spots in the dams, river embankments and waterways, and take thoroughgoing steps for repairing and reinforcing them immediately, while adopting scientific and technological measures for improving the growth of crops in the afflicted fields.\nBased on a detailed analysis of the pumping stations for drainage, they should double their capacity to keep farmland from being damaged by any possible flood, and provide a firm scientific and technical guarantee for their regular operation at full capacity.\nThey should focus on the political work aimed at instilling confidence in the junior officials of the farms and other farmers and mobilizing them, giving effective and responsible guidance over the work of repairing the damage done to the crops.\nThey should also give a strong impetus to restoring the arable land that has been buried or washed away.\nComrades,\nWe are currently facing a crucial task of disaster prevention, which is no less important and which is much more serious and urgent, than the huge rehabilitation project.\nRecently, the extent of damage caused by disastrous weather conditions is increasing worldwide year after year, and in actual fact, no part of our country is absolutely safe, i.e., insusceptible to flooding and typhoon.\nThis being the case, some officials neglect the disaster prevention work, arguing on their regional characteristics or browsing through meteorological observation records. Such is a very dangerous and unpardonable act which is tantamount to gambling with people\u2019s safety.\nRegional Party organizations and power organs should stake their future development on the prevention of recurrence of damage by disastrous weather conditions, putting themselves on tenterhooks and making redoubled efforts to preclude any more disastrous consequences.\nFor the present, they should set up a prompt and well-knit weather forecasting system and establish the discipline, order and system whereby all the sectors and units in their respective regions respond effectively to any disastrous weather conditions. In this way, they can keep themselves from being affected by the expected heavy rain and typhoon.\nDamage caused by the recent flood highlighted how important it is in the prevention of disasters to ensure close contact and cooperation among various sectors and regions.\nIn case of emergency regions should maintain close contacts, promptly informing one another of what elements are at risk and actively regulating and adjusting their responses. In particular, when heavy rain or flooding is imminent, all the units responsible for maintaining power stations and reservoir dams should absolutely obey the directives from the central organ that is in charge of the unified system for water control.\nIt is important for the state to renew its water control system and create a specialized institution in order to establish an integrated water control system for enforcing, adjusting and implementing a uniform water control policy, which will tackle various tasks facing regions, ranging from the supply of drinking water to responses to flooding, drought and other disasters.\nThe lesson taught by the recent flood damage has proved that our pressing task is to make the organs in charge of maintaining the dams enhance their role, and to ensure their integrated coordination and put it on a scientific footing quickly.\nHowever, the existing disaster prevention organs are lame-duck entities substituting their assignment for collecting statistics.\nThis offers a glimpse of our officials\u2019 irresponsible work style, and if they stick to their stereotypical way of thinking and formalistic work methods, such disaster prevention organs, however many, will bring no benefit to the state.\nIt is advisable to study the issues of setting a flood warning period in the rainy season, ensuring unified and coordinated management of the sectoral and regional units in charge of water control, and putting a flood response system in place.\nAlong with this, an integrated flood forecast system should be established in a more scientific way.\nAs I have already stressed, any lax approach of failing to consider the worst conditions in construction will inevitably invite a terrible disaster.\nWe should build new, excellent houses where geographical safety against disaster is assured and perfect measures have been adopted for disaster prevention, so that they will last for the coming 50 to 100 years.\nTo this end, appropriate sites of construction should be fixed with their safety assessment as a major criterion; a proper plan for the distribution and layout of houses should be drawn up to provide every convenience for the residents and satisfy their demands; and the durability of houses should be ensured by increasing the amount of building materials needed for each house and encouraging the builders to enhance their sense of responsibility.\nWhat is no less important than to ensure high speed and good quality in the construction of houses is to sustain their modernity commensurate with the increased level of civilization of our people.\nThe designing and construction of houses should be done in a non-repetitive, diversified and unique style so they can meet the modern tastes and preserve the characteristic features of the given regions and villages.\nI want to specially emphasize that there should be no wrong practice of demolishing the existing houses and building new ones on their very sites in a perfunctory manner without an accurate calculation.\nIt is also important to give the residents regular education on how to cope with disasters.\nWe should work effectively to heighten their consciousness of coping with disasters; define, on the basis of a detailed survey and confirmation, the spots where the residents are to take shelter in case of disaster, and work out guidelines for their evacuation; and give a strong impetus to securing essential means of rescue operation to be used in various emergency circumstances.\nAll the regions should conduct a comprehensive review and investigation of their capabilities to prevent natural calamities, discover the weak points and adopt timely measures for reinforcing them. Also, in anticipation of the worst situation caused by torrential rain, flooding, typhoon and tidal waves, they should identify, eradicate and take precautions against dangerous spots, while paying due attention to ensuring effective afforestation and water conservation.\nComrades,\nThe enormous undertakings for the repairing of the damage, which constitutes a big step in the course of alleviating the people's pain, providing them with greater welfare and transforming the regions, make a particularly high demand on the officials of the field Party and government organs.\nAll the officials should display the spirit of sincerely and devotedly assisting the people in the afflicted areas and sharing joy and sorrow with them.\nThe respect for and devoted service to the people are the inherent duty and obligation of our officials, and when the people suffer hardship, they should especially be faithful to their own duty.\nIn particular, all the Party officials should go deep among the masses to strengthen ties with them and, in the course of this, get fused into a harmonious whole with them to inspire them to the rehabilitation campaign.\nLast, I would like to emphasize the need to prevent any deviation in the assistance to the people in the afflicted areas.\nAt present, all parts of the country, as well as the Party Central Committee, the Cabinet, ministries and national agencies, are rendering assistance to the flood victims.\nAssistance work must be conducted strictly on the principle of voluntariness, never in an organized or forced way.\nIn the past, when such natural disasters as flooding occurred, institutions, enterprises and working people\u2019s organizations revealed such practices as pointing out the variety and quantity of relief supplies to collect them, while cadres, prompted by the desire for personal fame, subjectively gave assignments for assistance work to gather materials and send them.\nWe must not get our people to send aid even by imposing burdens on them on the pretext that they do not make any complaints, regarding it as their natural duty to help the residents in the afflicted areas.\nSuch assistance is worse than not offering at all.\nIt is needed to intensify the grasp and guidance over the whole society in order to make sure that the assistance work for the people in the afflicted areas is done on the principle of voluntariness, strictly in accordance with the will of each person, so that this work becomes a process in which our society\u2019s great traits of sharing pain and sorrow and helping and leading one another forward are truthfully manifested in name and reality.\nAt the same time, it is necessary to grasp and register aid funds and materials in a unified way and distribute and supply them in a fair and rational way, so that they can be used effectively for the stabilization of the living of the flood victims and the damage recovery, while imposing strict control lest there should appear such undesirable practices as fame seeking, misappropriation and fraud.\nAt present, many countries and international organizations are expressing their willingness to provide us with humanitarian assistance.\nI extend thanks to them.\nBut what we put forward first in all domains and processes of the state affairs is the way of addressing problems by relying on the firm trust in the people and entirely on our own efforts.\nWhat the Party Central Committee and the government relies on in the current rehabilitation campaign is also the patriotic enthusiasm and valour of our people and the potentials of our state from A to Z.\nAs we have always done, we will value our confidence in our own strength more than anything else, solve all problems by enlisting the strength and wisdom of the people, and continue to steadily expand and increase our state\u2019s strength in that way to shape our future with our own strength and efforts in the future, too.\nAs all the national efforts are concentrated on the rehabilitation project and all the planned work is being smoothly pushed forward under the unified and powerful guidance of our government, we will, by and large, remain consistent in this principle.\nComrades,\nNationwide concentration and all-people mobilization\u2013these have given us a good chance of sure victory in the repairing of the disaster.\nIn order to accomplish the tasks of the times, the historic tasks on which we decided and which we have shouldered by ourselves for our beloved people and our future, the Party and the government will readily brave any challenges and live up to the people\u2019s trust with their faithful service and excellent results.\nWe will serve the people faithfully.\nAnd we will always be with you.\nDear inhabitants of Uiju County and the city of Sinuiju,\nDear inhabitants of the afflicted areas in Jagang and Ryanggang provinces,\nPlease inform us open-heartedly through the relevant Party organizations at any time if you feel any inconveniences or difficulties.\nPlease wait for the day when you will lead a new life in your living place which will be changed more splendidly.\nAnd I wish you good health free from illnesses.\nLet all of us pool our strength to successfully overcome the present crisis and get up.\nLong live our great people! -0-",

He thanked them for invariably believing in our Party, saying rehabilitation doesn't matter as there exists such deep trust.\nFeeding children with confectionary he personally brought and putting lovely clothes on them, he said that seeing children he felt really encouraged and more deeply awakened to the sense of the duty he assumed to make the country stronger for the rising generations.\nFeeling the warm parental affection by the fatherly leader, who talked with them for a long time despite sultry weather, warmly taking their hands to console them and redouble their confidence and courage, flood victims hardly repressed their great emotion and thrust themselves into his embrace, raising stormy cheers in tears.\nFlood victims followed him step by step, reluctant to part from him. Telling them to go back, he promised to visit them again the next day\nHe met flood victims of Uiju County again on August 9 to clarify our Party and government's stand related to rehabilitation, take crucial measures and console them.\nHe made sure that aid materials prepared by the Party Central Committee for the flood victims of Sinuiju City and Uiju County were conveyed to them by his private train.\nHe also authorized the members of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee to convey the aid materials to the flood victims in Jagang and Ryanggang provinces on the spot.\nCadres of the Party Central Committee handed over the aid materials to the flood victims.\nThe flood victims of Uiju County, who received the aid materials associated with his warm care, raised loud cheers of \"Hurrah!\" in floods of tears, overwhelmed by deep gratitude, great happiness and high excitement.\nKim Jong Unshowed warm parental care for children, warmly hugging them in new clothes, caressing their hair and talking with them in whispers.\nHe made a consolatory speech before the flood victims.\nNoting that he came again to acquaint himself in more detail about their living conditions on the spot, reassign a series of tasks related to the recovery work and take crucial state measures helpful to the victims in addition, he said that he felt much relieved and greatly encouraged to see all of them living in good health without any inconvenience.\nPointing out that the people constitute the foundation and pillar of the Party and the state, the starting point and the focus of all their activities, he said that he takes pride in the people absolutely and unconditionally believing in the Party and the government even in the period of disaster-brought hardship. He told them about the important measures to be taken, clarifying the stand of the Party and the government on the issue of promoting the flood victims' living and rehabilitation.\nRecalling that the Party and the state concentrate their efforts on the rehabilitation campaign, he said that strong construction forces, including service personnel of the People's Army and young people, had already been deployed and transport of rehabilitation materials is underway under an emergency system.\nThe most urgent issue, arising in the period of two or three months until the housing construction is completed and their living stabilized, is the one of life and education of children and students, he said, adding that childcare, edification and education are the primary state affairs never to be given up in any emergency situation.\nHe announced such an important measure as putting into operation an emergency system to bring all the children and students in the families of flood victims in North Phyongan, Jagang and Ryanggang provinces to Pyongyang to take educational care of them in a secure and convenient environment at the expenses of the state and in its direct charge until the rehabilitation finishes, and rendering state-backed protection and care to the old and sick persons, honoured disabled soldiers and baby mums after bringing them to Pyongyang.\nHe said that he leaves everything to individual intentions and decisions of the flood victims for there may be different personal problems but the above-said measure is to be taken as a top priority of the state so the Party and the government will take full charge and care of the health and life of the flood victims who will come to Pyongyang in the sincerest manner and do their best to that end.\nNoting that the enemies persist in their foolish attempt to abuse the flood damage suffered by us as a chance for tarnishing the image of our state, he denounced the enemies on the strongest rhetorical terms, branding their fabrications as a smear campaign and a grave provocation against the DPRK and an insult to the flood-stricken people who are all safe and well.\nThere is no need to make educational materials exclusively as such a stark fact serves as good educational materials for giving a clear understanding of what a disgusting clan the enemies are, what an extremely anachronistic mode they have employed in their fabrications and politically-motivated false propaganda, what a black-hearted intention lurks behind it, and why we call them enemies and human scum, he stressed.\nNoting that we are facing a very important task to prevent natural disasters, which is more serious and urgent than the on-going large-scale rehabilitation, he set forth the tasks and ways for building nationwide disaster-prevention capabilities, including the issue of establishing a rapid and orderly weather forecast system for proactively controlling the factors vulnerable to natural disasters, and the issue of setting up an integrated water control system in all units in charge of managing power stations and dams, in particular.\nExpressing thanks to various foreign countries and international organizations for their offer of humanitarian support, he said what we regard as the best in all realms and processes of state affairs is the firm trust in the people and the way of tackling problems thoroughly based on self-reliance.   Our Party Central Committee and government will depend entirely on the patriotic enthusiasm and courage of our people and the potentialities of our country in the ongoing rehabilitation, too, he added.\nReferring to the fact that the DPRK has taken sure advantage in the ongoing rehabilitation by dint of nationwide concentration and all-people mobilization, he solemnly declared that our Party and government will readily brave any challenges to accomplish without fail the tasks of the times, the historic tasks which they decided and shouldered of their own accord for our great people and future, and surely live up to the people's trust with faithful service and good results.\nThe undying story, in whichKim Jong Unvisited the flood-stricken people again to console and encourage them and take important state measures repeatedly for stabilizing their living and successfully carrying out the rehabilitation, will be recorded in history as another legendary tale about his paternal love for the people to be etched in the great father's journey of devoted service, and as a significant event that adds vitality to the drive of the people all out in response to the Party's call, proving once again that the programme and policies of the WPK and the DPRK government are based on the people-first doctrine. -0-",

He created the ways and tactics of the anti-Japanese armed struggle in an original way on the basis of the actual conditions of the country and always won victories in battles against the Japanese imperialists who styled themselves \"invincible imperial army\".\nThe historic victory in the anti-Japanese armed struggle showed to the world that if the oppressed popular masses of colonial countries wage armed struggle in reliance on their own revolutionary forces, they can defeat any imperialist aggression forces.\nWith this example of the national liberation revolution in colonies as an occasion, many countries and peoples under the yoke of the imperialists came to achieve their independence through armed struggle and embark on the road of building a new society. -0-",

I was deeply moved by the citizens\u2019 ennobling spiritual world.\nAt this moment, large numbers of Party members and young people from the capital city are working hard to restore the flood-hit areas, and relief supplies from Pyongyang are continuously being sent to these areas.\nIt is heartbreaking that people in some parts and regions of the country experienced mental pain owing to the unexpected natural disaster, but in the face of the pain and trials our grand socialist family has been rallied more closely and united more firmly with an ennobling feeling.\nAnd our confidence in changing today\u2019s disaster to a watershed for transforming regions has become more unwavering based on this unity of the whole society.\nWe will transform regions.\nThis is our ideal, and we are capable of turning it into reality.\nThe natural disaster was a stumbling block to our advance, but in these trials we have found another driving force for defending our ideal and bringing it into full bloom.\nBy dint of this force, we will renovate your home villages, workplaces and schools, precious parts of our country, more beautifully and more wonderfully.\nThis time we are not going to confine ourselves to simply rebuilding the afflicted areas, but we will turn them into a model and textbook of regions becoming urbanized, modernized and civilized.\nSoon the places destroyed by flooding and landslides will become transformed and richer beyond recognition without fail.\nTherefore, please, all of you, have a good, happy time here without any worry.\nI hope that the officials and employees of the April 25 Hostel and the base for military parade training, as well as others concerned, will work hard so that these disaster victims can be in a better condition than before, when returning to their dear native places that will be transformed beyond recognition.\nI entrust these elderly people, mothers and children to the members of the mobile education teams in charge of the teaching and edification of the children, and to the members of the mobile medical teams who are responsible for patient treatment and elderly care. I am in firm belief that these mobile team members will show utmost sincerity and selfless devotion.\nAvailing myself of this opportunity, I would like to extend my thanks once again to you for invariably trusting and supporting our Party.\nDear citizens,\nComrades,\nThe trust placed in us by our people\u2013this is our biggest and most valuable asset which cannot be compared to any material wealth.\nI reaffirm that we are ready to go through thick and thin to prove ourselves worthy of the great trust shown by our people, and that we will work with devotion for the good of our great people and faithfully serve them.\nToday it is a significant holiday, which marks the liberation of our country.\nI hope that the elderly, women and all others from the flood-hit areas will enjoy this holiday happily and have an unforgettable and significant time while staying in the capital city of their beloved motherland.\nThank you. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- The Institute for American Studies of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea released the following press statement \"To bolster up self-defensive power for defending security environment of Korean peninsula and region is urgent requirement of times\" on August 18:\nThe U.S. and the ROK are going to stage Ulji Freedom Shield, large-scale provocative joint military exercises, from August 19 to 29.\nEven vassal countries affiliated to the \"UN Command\" will reportedly take part in the exercises involving 48 rounds of various outdoor mobile trainings such as live firing and landing drill on the sea and in the sky.\nThus, Ulji Freedom Shield fully betrays its dangerous colors as the biggest military training in the Asia-Pacific region and offensive multinational muscle-flexing involving even NATO member states.\nThe Institute for American Studies of the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK makes public this press statement to disclose the rash confrontational moves of the U.S. and the ROK escalating regional military confrontation and contradiction by kicking off such aggressive large-scale joint military exercises despite strong internal and external opposition.\n\nIs Ulji Freedom Shield \"defensive\" and \"transparent\"\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State recently termed the U.S.-ROK joint military exercises \"regular\" and \"defensive\", touting their \"transparency.\"\nThis is no more than rhetoric to cover up the dangerous and grave nature of their joint military drills and evade international community's criticism.\nIt is clearly recorded in the world history of wars that in preparation for a war, aggressor states followed a series of procedures, including adoption of war policy and military operation plan for its execution, advance deployment of forces, ceaseless simulated and actual war drills and war provocation.\nThe current U.S. administration has more openly pursued the policy of using nuclear weapons against the DPRK by specifying the \"end of regime\" of the latter as a goal in its \"nuclear posture review\" made public after its inauguration. It has put into practice its nuclear confrontation policy against the DPRK by releasing the \"Washington Declaration\", establishing a new U.S.-ROK \"nuclear consultative group\" and cooking up the \"guidelines on nuclear strategic plan and its operation.\"\nAccording to them, nuclear-powered submarines of the U.S. frequented the waters near the Korean peninsula in 2023, seven times as much as in 2022, and the number of flights of its fighters and bombers in the sky above it has quadrupled. Against this backdrop, nuclear carrier strike groups are being deployed there one after another along with massive introduction of U.S. latest war hardware such as F-35 stealth fighters and SM-6 ship-to-air interceptor missiles.\nF-16 fighters, which had been stationed in the Kunsan air base, were moved to the Osan air base near Seoul to form a \"super-powerful wing.\" And U.S. offensive  assets are concentrated on areas near the southern border of the DPRK.\nWorse still, the number of outdoor mobile training, staged as part of Ulji Freedom Shield, increased to 38 in 2023 and 48 in 2024, and has turned into provocative special warfare ones such special war training aimed at \"occupation of Pyongyang\" and \"beheading operation.\"\nNotably, the current exercises, including a drill simulating a nuclear confrontation with the DPRK, bring to light clearer the provocative nature of Ulji Freedom Shield as a prelude to a nuclear war.\n\"Transparency\" of the joint military drills touted by the U.S. is no more than trickery to deceive the international community.\nMost of the countries, which are to \"observe\" whether the U.S.-ROK joint military exercises are staged in conformity with the requirements of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are member states of the \"UN Command\" or NATO member states under the control of the U.S. So it is clearly evident that it is utterly impossible to expect any neutrality or impartiality from them.\nAll facts prove that Ulji Freedom Shield is neither \"defensive\" nor \"transparent\" but the most offensive and provocative war drills for aggression in the world.\n\nWhat impact have the U.S.-led joint military exercises had on international peace and stability\n\nIt is the typical method of the U.S. to pursue its unilateral and absolute security by infringing upon other countries' security and interests.\nIt is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. and its vassal countries have staged more than 200 joint military drills in the world annually and they have become more threatening in their nature.\nAs for RIMPAC kicked off in 1971 against the former Soviet Union, the joint military maneuvers didn't disappear despite the end of the Soviet-U.S. Cold War but have developed into the world's biggest multinational maritime joint military drills under the pretext of \"defeating\" new \"virtual enemy.\"\nFrom late July to early August this year, RIMPAC was staged in the largest-scale ever, involving 40 warships, three submarines, 150-odd aircraft and 25 000 troops from 29 countries.\nInternational security experts unanimously commented that the forms and contents of RIMPAC clearly prove that they are aimed at laying siege to and deter China.\nU.S.-led joint military drills are being staged frequently also in the European region, distressed by the world's worst-ever security crisis brought by the Ukrainian incident, to spark off great concern of the international community.\nThe U.S.-led joint military exercises Steadfast Defender were staged in the largest scale ever since the end of the Cold War near the border of Russia from January to May this year with the involvement of more than 90 000 forces, at least 50 warships including aircraft carriers, 80-odd fighter jets, over 1 100 combat vehicles.\nThe exercises, aimed at restoring the ever-dampening atmosphere of supporting Ukraine among European countries and inducing them to increase military expenditure, fully show the hostile intention of the U.S. to militarily deter Russia and seize the military hegemony in the region.\nIt is the fact never to be concealed and denied that the U.S.-led joint military drills are the grave root cause of escalating military confrontation and causing sustained instability across the world.\n\nWhat is the best way to ensure peace and stability\n\nShortly ago, the U.S. secretaries of State and Defense and the assistant to the president for National Security of the White House, in an article they jointly contribute to the press, betrayed the sinister intention to seize military hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region by inveigling not only regional vassal countries including Japan and the ROK but also countries outside the region.\nThis shows that the U.S.-led joint military drills have nothing to do with \"preserving regional security\" touted by it and its allied forces but serve as a political and military means to take more countries on the confrontation chariot driven by it to realize its hegemony.\nActually, major NATO members are taking part in the U.S.-ROK joint military exercises recently under the signboard of member states of the \"UN Command\" and the military nexus between Japan, the ROK and NATO is getting further tightened.\nThe U.S., which included in its defense budgets the \"Pacific deterrence plan\" of drastically reinforcing its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region in recently years, has annually increased the allotment for carrying it out. This predicts that the U.S. and its vassal countries would more openly engage in military intervention in the Korean peninsula and its vicinity.\nThe prevailing situation requires the independent and sovereign states to constantly maintain the balance of power for preventing a war by stockpiling the greatest deterrence for guaranteeing their sovereignty, security and interests in every way in the current and future uncertain security environment.\nThe more frequently the U.S. and its vassal countries commit collective military provocations, the stronger the deterrence of justice for neutralizing the threat there from and ensuring regional and global peace and stability will become.\nWe will continue to make crucial efforts to build up strong defence capabilities for creditably defending our state sovereignty, security, interests and territorial integrity and change the security environment of the Korean peninsula and the region in our favour. -0-",

As a result, the global security environment is being pushed to the threshold of the third world war.\nThe time will prove what is the danger of the U.S. ignorant move to drive the Kiev authorities into a proxy war until the last Ukrainian is left, seized with a hallucinant dream to bring a strategic defeat to Russia at any cost and what consequences it will entail.\nThose who do irresponsible and fearless acts will be made to pay a dear price for their acts, and provocateurs will be subject to due retaliation.\nThe U.S. and its followers should seriously reconsider the catastrophic disaster to be entailed by the self-destructive military provocations perpetrated by the Zelenskiy puppet clique and be wholly responsible for it.\nWe do not doubt that the brave army and people of Russia will deal a merciless military blow to the armed invaders and attain their goal to the last in Kursk, the hero land that defeated the large army of the Hitler fascist clique more than 80 years ago and opened a turning phase of war.\nThe present Kursk battle will be a prelude to the total destruction of the Zelenskiy puppet clique and the strategic defeat of the U.S. and the West.\nThe DPRK will always stand together with the Russian Federation that has turned out valiantly in the struggle for international justice and invariably and strongly support the sacred war of the Russian army and people to defend the sovereignty, security and interests of the state. -0-",

It has put into practice its nuclear confrontation policy against the DPRK by releasing the \"Washington Declaration\", establishing a new U.S.-ROK \"nuclear consultative group\" and cooking up the \"guidelines on nuclear strategic plan and its operation.\"\nAccording to them, nuclear-powered submarines of the U.S. frequented the waters near the Korean peninsula in 2023, seven times as much as in 2022, and the number of flights of its fighters and bombers in the sky above it has quadrupled. Against this backdrop, nuclear carrier strike groups are being deployed there one after another along with massive introduction of U.S. latest war hardware such as F-35 stealth fighters and SM-6 ship-to-air interceptor missiles.\nF-16 fighters, which had been stationed in the Kunsan air base, were moved to the Osan air base near Seoul to form a \"super-powerful wing.\" And U.S. offensive  assets are concentrated on areas near the southern border of the DPRK.\nWorse still, the number of outdoor mobile training, staged as part of Ulji Freedom Shield, increased to 38 in 2023 and 48 in 2024, and has turned into provocative special warfare ones such special war training aimed at \"occupation of Pyongyang\" and \"beheading operation.\"\nNotably, the current exercises, including a drill simulating a nuclear confrontation with the DPRK, bring to light clearer the provocative nature of Ulji Freedom Shield as a prelude to a nuclear war.\n\"Transparency\" of the joint military drills touted by the U.S. is no more than trickery to deceive the international community.\nMost of the countries, which are to \"observe\" whether the U.S.-ROK joint military exercises are staged in conformity with the requirements of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are member states of the \"UN Command\" or NATO member states under the control of the U.S. So it is clearly evident that it is utterly impossible to expect any neutrality or impartiality from them.\nAll facts prove that Ulji Freedom Shield is neither \"defensive\" nor \"transparent\" but the most offensive and provocative war drills for aggression in the world.\n\nWhat impact have the U.S.-led joint military exercises had on international peace and stability\n\nIt is the typical method of the U.S. to pursue its unilateral and absolute security by infringing upon other countries' security and interests.\nIt is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. and its vassal countries have staged more than 200 joint military drills in the world annually and they have become more threatening in their nature.\nAs for RIMPAC kicked off in 1971 against the former Soviet Union, the joint military maneuvers didn't disappear despite the end of the Soviet-U.S. Cold War but have developed into the world's biggest multinational maritime joint military drills under the pretext of \"defeating\" new \"virtual enemy.\"\nFrom late July to early August this year, RIMPAC was staged in the largest-scale ever, involving 40 warships, three submarines, 150-odd aircraft and 25 000 troops from 29 countries.\nInternational security experts unanimously commented that the forms and contents of RIMPAC clearly prove that they are aimed at laying siege to and deter China.\nU.S.-led joint military drills are being staged frequently also in the European region, distressed by the world's worst-ever security crisis brought by the Ukrainian incident, to spark off great concern of the international community.\nThe U.S.-led joint military exercises Steadfast Defender were staged in the largest scale ever since the end of the Cold War near the border of Russia from January to May this year with the involvement of more than 90 000 forces, at least 50 warships including aircraft carriers, 80-odd fighter jets, over 1 100 combat vehicles.\nThe exercises, aimed at restoring the ever-dampening atmosphere of supporting Ukraine among European countries and inducing them to increase military expenditure, fully show the hostile intention of the U.S. to militarily deter Russia and seize the military hegemony in the region.\nIt is the fact never to be concealed and denied that the U.S.-led joint military drills are the grave root cause of escalating military confrontation and causing sustained instability across the world.\n\nWhat is the best way to ensure peace and stability\n\nShortly ago, the U.S. secretaries of State and Defense and the assistant to the president for National Security of the White House, in an article they jointly contribute to the press, betrayed the sinister intention to seize military hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region by inveigling not only regional vassal countries including Japan and the ROK but also countries outside the region.\nThis shows that the U.S.-led joint military drills have nothing to do with \"preserving regional security\" touted by it and its allied forces but serve as a political and military means to take more countries on the confrontation chariot driven by it to realize its hegemony.\nActually, major NATO members are taking part in the U.S.-ROK joint military exercises recently under the signboard of member states of the \"UN Command\" and the military nexus between Japan, the ROK and NATO is getting further tightened.\nThe U.S., which included in its defense budgets the \"Pacific deterrence plan\" of drastically reinforcing its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region in recently years, has annually increased the allotment for carrying it out. This predicts that the U.S. and its vassal countries would more openly engage in military intervention in the Korean peninsula and its vicinity.\nThe prevailing situation requires the independent and sovereign states to constantly maintain the balance of power for preventing a war by stockpiling the greatest deterrence for guaranteeing their sovereignty, security and interests in every way in the current and future uncertain security environment.\nThe more frequently the U.S. and its vassal countries commit collective military provocations, the stronger the deterrence of justice for neutralizing the threat there from and ensuring regional and global peace and stability will become.\nWe will continue to make crucial efforts to build up strong defence capabilities for creditably defending our state sovereignty, security, interests and territorial integrity and change the security environment of the Korean peninsula and the region in our favour. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 20 (KCNA) -- Growing fiercer in the puppet ROK is the struggle of people from all walks of life against puppet Yoon Suk Yeol, a sycophantic zealously following the U.S. preoccupied by its ambition for hegemony and paving the way for a criminal state Japan's reinvasion.\nThe 103rd candlelight rally and demonstration were staged in Seoul on August 17 with the attendance of many people from different parts, including workers, peasants, students and citizens.\nThe Confederation of Trade Unions and other organizations had prior meetings in different parts of Seoul, vowing to turn out in the all-people action for ousting Yoon.\nSpeakers charged that \"freedom\", cried out by Yoon on Aug. 15 while turning his face away from the past history of Japan, a war criminal state, is little short of providing freedom for the U.S. to ignite a war in the world, for the revival of Japan's militarism and its \"Self-Defense Forces'\" aggression and for the monopoly capital to exploit the workers to infinity. They called on the workers, peasants and all other walks of life to get united to show their mettle to monstrous Yoon, saying that now is the time to fight for an all-out war against him who puts the country and population into pain.\nThe participants held a ceremony of declaring an all-out war against puppet Yoon and kindling the torch of struggle.\nThen there took place the 103rd candlelight rally demanding the impeachment of Yoon.\nCharging that Yoon Suk Yeol's policy toward Japan is to promote Japan's position to a security ally from a colonial criminal state and open up the second colonial era in which its \"SDF\" sets the foot of aggression on this land, speakers at the rally stressed that any slight compromise with the Yoon regime would be just a pro-Japanese act.\nThen representatives of the candlelight actions in different regions read out a resolution on the nationwide candlelight demonstrations in August.\nThe resolution said that the parliamentary impeachment of Yoon became a fait accompli with more than 1.43 million petitioners involved and the candlelight resistance has entered a stage for rounding off the impeachment by the overwhelming public mindset. All-people resistance will be aroused through a forthcoming 100-day campaign to impeach Yoon without fail this year, it added.\nThe participants in the rally proposed an all-people 100-day general movement for the impeachment of Yoon, declaring that they would launch a signature campaign urging the regional law-makers to bring an impeachment bill, and the regional all-people rally, declaration on situation, fund-raising action for impeachment and other events.\nThe law-makers' meeting in company with the candlelight action, too, stated that Yoon Suk Yeol should be impeached at once and the political camp should implement the orders of the population, contending that he is returning to the era of Park Chung Hee's dictatorship as shown through his recent appointment of high-ranking officials. The minister of Defense was appointed as the head of the state security office and the head of the presidential guard as minister of Defense. Through them, Yoon is seeking to declare a \"martial law\" and then turn this land into a sea of war flames, it pointed out.\nAt the end of the rally, its participants staged a demonstration toward the puppet presidential office, chanting such slogans as \"Impeach Yoon Suk Yeol, a Japanese spy at the government-general in Ryongsan!\"\nMeanwhile, through press conferences, statements and commentaries, organizations of various circles strongly demanded the impeachment of puppet Yoon seeking to ignite a war.\nMedia of the puppet ROK reported that nothing could break the will of the candlelight demonstrators demanding the impeachment of Yoon and that the only way for preventing a nuclear war crisis is to impeach Yoon and this is the will of those involved in the candlelight actions. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 24 (KCNA) -- On August 24, 1945, the Japan-flagged ship Ukishima-maru carrying thousands of Koreans was blown up and sunk in the waters off Maizuru Port of Japan.\nAfter hearing the news of the defeat of the Japanese imperialists, a large number of Koreans who were subject to medieval slave labor in Japan were so pleased that they were able to return their beloved home as Korea was liberated on August 15, 1945.\nThe Japanese reactionaries hatched a massacre plot in order to give vent to their anger at the defeat. So they persuaded or forced many Koreans to use the ship, saying that it is the only ship to sail to Korea.\nAt that time, ships of more than 100 tons were not allowed to sail in the territorial waters of Japan under the order of the Allied Forces, but the sailing of Ukishima-maru of over 4 000 tons was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Navy.\nOn August 22, 1945, the ship left Ominato Port with a small amount of fuel, sailed to the south along the western coast of Japan, and suddenly turned the helm near the port of Maizuru.\nOn Aug. 24, 1945, the Japanese on board fled by boat just before the explosion.\nSoon, loud explosive sounds were heard several times and the ship was sunk, broken in two. And the Koreans were buried at sea.\nAfter the incident occurred, the Japanese reactionaries made desperate efforts to cover up the truth behind the explosion of Ukishima-maru, terming it a \"sinking accident caused by a mine\".\nBut the Japanese reactionaries' assertion was clearly proved to be a sheer lie by the testimonies of the survivors and all the corroborative facts.\nThe explosion was not a mere sinking accident but a massacre committed according to the Japanese imperialists' premeditated and intentional manipulation.\nThis incident tells us how persistent and barbarous Japan's policy of exterminating the Korean nation was. -0-",

After all, NATO came to lose the justification for its existence to \"defend the free world from communist threat\".\nUnder such situation, NATO got hell-bent on laying a legal foundation to hold hegemony in the international military and political arena by expanding the mission and duty of the organization, which had been confined to the \"regional collective defence\", to \"ensuring world security\".\nThe bloody footprints of NATO's aggression, marked in East Europe, Asia and Africa in succession after the disappearance of the East-West confrontation structure in ideology with the end of the Cold War, were by no means attributable to their ideological difference.\nThe present Ukrainian crisis is the latest instance eloquently proving the unchangeable sinister intention of NATO to dominate the world and hold global supremacy.\nAfter the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, NATO made its commitment to the world never to seek the expansion of alliance targeting Russia\nBut it discarded its promise to the international community and has doubled its body by accepting 16 countries on seven occasions since 1999.\nDespite repeated concerns and warnings of Russia, NATO pushed ahead with its continuous advance toward the East while seriously violating security interests of the sovereign state and, moreover, tried to draw even Ukraine bordering Russia into the sphere of its influence. Such reckless moves for expanding its sphere are the main factor that brought the present security situation to Europe\nNow, NATO is inciting the hirelings of the Kiev authorities to attack the territory of Russia with arms offered by the U.S. and the West, out of its sinister plan to spread the flames of the Ukrainian battlefield to the Russian mainland at any cost. Recently, it is feigning ignorance of such dangerous military acts as an attack on nuclear power plants.\nMore than 900 days of the Ukrainian crisis, which has been going on for years accompanied by the unprecedented risk of a nuclear war outbreak, can be called a long-length drama of history that has clearly shown once again to the world people the sinister intention of NATO which does not hesitate to gamble any terror only for its geopolitical interests.\nNATO is the world's biggest war alliance in view of its scale and duration of existence or its anti-peace evil deeds recorded in history.\nThe white paper disclosed the fact that NATO is making desperate efforts to bring a new war cloud to the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn June 2022, NATO adopted a new \"strategic conception\" specifying the future strategic direction, with the Madrid summit in Spain as an occasion. In the \"conception\", it defined China as a \"systematic challenge\" and Russia as \"the most grave and direct threat\".\nIn the past, NATO tried to expand its jurisdiction to such world issues as WMD proliferation, terrorism, cyber attack and climate change through revision of the \"strategic conception\". But it had never formulated specific countries as strategic foes.\nConsidering that NATO's \"strategic conception\", published for about ten cyclic years, is a major document second in importance after its treaty as it is intended to regulate the organization's long-term action guidelines, the adoption of new \"strategic conception\" suggests that NATO has definitely turned its course to the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn particular, politicians of the U.S., little short of the chief of NATO, are now openly making an ill-bodying assertion that the treaty should interpreted on an extension basis or revised so that the application scope of the alliance's collective defense can be expanded to the U.S. territory in the Pacific including Hawaii.\nBesides, NATO is amplifying the \"theory of threat from Russia and China\" under the pretext of the Ukrainian situation and the situation of the Straits of Taiwan on different occasions, including the Vilnius Summit in 2023 and the Washington Summit in 2024. It is also trying to \"justify\" its advance into the Asia-Pacific region, claiming \"the Atlantic and the Pacific are inseparable in terms of security\".\nIt is the truth proved by history and reality that if NATO, which has been branded as a war machine by world people, enters any region, there is nothing good from A to Z.\nNATO, which has been stretching out its feet to the Asia-Pacific region, is now mobilizing various strategic assets for the U.S.-led joint military drills in the region, including the RIMPAC joint military maneuvers and Balikatan. This is why the war machinery called NATO is running all the year round in the Asia-Pacific region, which should have been the hub of global peace and prosperity.\nWhat should not be overlooked is that NATO has often slandered the DPRK's legitimate measures for bolstering up its capabilities for self-defence and intensified military infiltration into the Korean peninsula and its vicinity under that pretext.\nAll the circumstances go to prove that the plan for the \"expansion of NATO into the rest of the world\", worked out by the U.S. to realize its ambition for world domination after the termination of the Cold War, is being pushed forward with through the \"expansion of NATO into Asia-Pacific region\", and that the main course of the \"aggressor fleet\" called NATO has been turned towards the Korean peninsula.\nIf NATO, the world's largest group sharing nukes, continues its \"crusade\" towards the hot spot with nuclear weapons states as the main targets, the whole world will move a step and a step nearer to the threshold of a nuclear war.\nNot content with driving the security environment of the whole of Europe to an extreme phase, NATO is running amuck to bring new dark clouds of war to the Asia-Pacific region. It is, indeed, the worst group of confrontation in history.\nThe white paper stressed that the DPRK will redouble its responsible efforts to ensure balance of forces in the region, deter the outbreak of a new war and contribute to global peace and security in coping with the present military and political environment that is getting serious in its vicinity and the prospective security challenge. -0-",

To this end, it is necessary to make higher demands by the field commanding officers and construction control organs and further enhance their roles, he stressed again.\nWatching for a while the soldier-builders working, he instructed the accompanying officials to provide them with better working and living conditions and further intensify the frontline-style political information and motivational work to give full play to their spiritual strength.\nHe underlined the need for the provincial, city and county Party organizations and people\u2019s committees at different levels to make preparations, such as creation of raw materials bases and training of skilled workers, in a responsible manner so as to keep the operation of the factories at full capacity after the completion of their construction, and ensure that the regional people enjoy benefits from them.\nSetting forth a new policy of accelerating the implementation of the historic cause of regional rejuvenation by pushing ahead with the construction of public health facilities, sci-tech learning spaces and grain management stations, simultaneously with the on-going construction of regional-industry factories, in order to hasten the accomplishment of the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy for bringing about a remarkable improvement in the regional economy and people\u2019s living standards, he clarified the stand of the Party Central Committee to take crucial measures to carry it out.\nPointing out that the Party made the crucial decision in such a harsh period as now as it was indispensable to bringing earlier a new era of epochal development and comprehensive rejuvenation in all regions at the same time, he said that it would be most reasonable to complete the sci-tech learning spaces and finish the framework construction of hospitals and grain management stations, taking advantage of the deployment of People\u2019s Army units in the relevant regions for construction of their factories, and take state-sponsored measures to give finishing touches to the hospitals and grain management stations and inaugurate them later in yearly order.\nIt is an indispensable task to be fulfilled without fail to build large-scale, modern hospitals in cities and counties, where the modernization level of public health facilities is relatively lower than those of the capital and provincial cities, so as to promote the health of the regional people, he said, giving detailed instructions that in order to carry out the huge task, it is necessary to take measures to give precedence to the construction of their buildings by dovetailing it with the schedule of construction of the regional-industry factories, and furnish them with necessary equipment according to the state\u2019s plan in the future.\nStressing the need to build sci-tech learning centres, he said:\nOur purpose of urbanizing the rural communities is not merely to model the countryside on urban architectural beauty but to transform as early as possible the regional forces on a working-class pattern and make them progressive and well-versed in science and technology on a level not inferior to those in the urban areas. As a practical way, it is necessary to set up a sci-tech learning centre in every city and county for dissemination of knowledge needed in various fields, he said, adding it is an important task conforming to the Party\u2019s policy on building a country that develops on the strength of science and technology.\nGiving an instruction to commonly call various facilities for processing and storing grains grain management stations, he said that they should be rebuilt under the direct control of the state, not merely in a passive attitude of repairing the existing facilities, so as to properly store and manage grains, harvested with much effort, without wasting even a single grain, and provide the people with well-processed grains in particular.\nAs the construction of regional-industry factories is proceeding on a full scale across the country and the system of construction workforce, supply of materials and command has been established in a relatively well-regulated way, it is the best option in terms of time and profitability to push ahead with the simultaneous construction of modern hospitals, sci-tech learning centres and grain management stations in every city and county on this occasion, he re-affirmed, adding that when the regional development policy becomes a comprehensive one that covers public health, science and education, not confined to the construction of light-industry factories, it can make a genuine, tangible contribution to the improvement of the material and cultural life of the regional people and drastically raise the efficiency of regional development.\nThere would be no remaining manpower in cities and counties as it would be too much for them to build all the new houses with their construction workforces, but if the vital undertakings are neglected, our dream of regional development will remain an empty slogan, he stressed, adding our Party made a bold decision, placing its trust in our army, the faithful defender, supporter and implementer of the Party\u2019s policies, the pioneer of civilization in the new era and the artist of people\u2019s happiness. He set forth detailed orientation for the army units mobilized for the construction of regional-industry factories to properly organize and allocate manpower and meticulously draw up the construction timetable to successfully carry out their new tasks.\nHe said that leading officials of relevant sectors would deeply study detailed plans and ways for implementing the higher ten-year goal for regional development before deliberating them and make decisions at a plenary meeting to be held in December, and substantially carry them out in yearly order.\nThe tasks are huge and the conditions are difficult, but if we work harder, we can surely realize our ideals, and it is a trait unique to the Korean revolutionaries to assume heavy duties by themselves in hard times, he said, adding regions and rural communities will literally get rid of their century-old backwardness and undergo complete transformation and the appearance of our state be changed beyond recognition 10 years later when the grandiose goals will have been attained. Calling for finding the worth of waging the revolution and tiding over today\u2019s difficulties, picturing that day, he expressed his conviction that the grand projects, which will serve as a great stride in accelerating the process of regional rejuvenation, will be accomplished without fail.\nHis field guidance at the construction sites of regional-industry factories will be etched in history as an important occasion, in which an important guideline and militant banner for enriching the Party\u2019s Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy and developing it onto a new high was provided, and as another political event of epochal significance in the leadership activities of the WPK that remains boundlessly faithful to the duty it assumed at the time of its founding to reflect the people\u2019s desires and demands in its policies and fulfill them. -0-",

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) --Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, gave field guidance at various regional-industry factories under construction on August 24 and 25.\nHe was accompanied by Jo Yong Won, Pak Jong Chon, Kim Jae Ryong, Pak Thae Song, O Su Yong, Ju Chang Il, Kim Chol Sam and Kim Hwa Song, leading officials of the Central Committee of the WPK.\nHe was greeted by commanding officers of the military units involved in the construction of industrial factories in the relevant regions.\nWatching the plans for layouts of industrial factories and greenery in the regions, he was briefed on the progress made in construction projects by the commanding officers. Then he inspected the construction sties.\nIt seems as if I pressed the detonator at a groundbreaking ceremony heralding the arrival of a new era of regional development a few days ago, but factories have already taken shape, he said, expressing great satisfaction over the fact that the overall construction project has been carried out at over 80 percent.\nExamining carefully whether the construction of factories was done as specified in the production line designs to ensure smooth operation of equipment and maximum labor productivity, their interior walls were insulated to retain heat and exterior tiling was done impeccably, he estimated the quality level of construction.\nSaying that builders should never neglect the improvement of quality in construction, a policy requirement, as they may done so, carried away by the single desire to finish the construction of factories earlier, he called for building the regional-industry factories, which the Party promised to the people and the People's Army pledged to present to them as gift, to be impeccable even in the distant future. To this end, it is necessary to make higher demands on the field commanding officers and construction control organs and further enhance their roles, he added.\nWatching the soldier-builders' skilled work for a while, he instructed the accompanying officials to provide them with better working and living conditions and further intensify the frontline-style agit-prop activities to give full play to their mental power.\nHe underlined the need for the provincial, city and county Party organizations and people's committees at different levels to conduct the preparatory work, such as establishment of raw material supply bases and training of skilled workers, in a responsible manner so as to keep the factories in full-capacity operation after the completion of their buildings so that the regional people would benefit from them.\nSetting forth a new policy of accelerating the implementation of the historic cause of regional rejuvenation by pushing ahead the building of public health facilities, sci-tech learning spaces and grain management stations, simultaneously with the on-going construction of regional-industry factories, in order to hasten the accomplishment of the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy for bringing about a remarkable improvement in the regional economy and people's living standard, he clarified the decision of the Party Central Committee to make crucial measures to carry it out.\nPointing out that the Party made a crucial decision in such a harsh period as now as it is indispensable to bringing earlier a new era of epochal development and comprehensive development to all regions at the same time, he said that it would be most reasonable to complete the sci-tech learning spaces and finish the framework construction of hospitals and grain management stations, occasioned by the deployment of People's Army units in the relevant regions for construction of their industrial factories, and take state-sponsored measures to inaugurate the hospitals and grain management stations later in yearly order.\nIt is arising as the most essential task to be fulfilled without fail to successfully build large-scale modern hospitals in cities and counties of the regions, where the modernization level of public health faculties are relatively lower than those of the capital city, so as to promote the health of the regional people, he said, giving detailed instructions that in order to carry out the huge task, it is necessary to take measures to give precedence to the construction of their buildings, in parallel with the regional-industry factories' on schedule, and furnish them with necessary equipment, according to future state plans.\nUnderlining the need to build sci-tech learning centers, he said our purpose of urbanizing the rural villages is to transform as early as possible the regional people on a working-class pattern and make them progressive and well-versed in science and technology, not merely to model the countryside on urban architectural beauty. As a practical way, it is necessary to set up \"sci-tech learning centers\" in every city and county and disseminate knowledge needed in various fields, he said, adding it is an important affair conforming to the Party policy to build a country developing with science and technology.\nGiving an instruction to commonly call various facilities for processing and storing grain \"grain management stations\", he said that they should be completely rebuilt under the direct control of the state, not merely in a passive attitude of repairing the existing facilities, in order to properly store and manage grain harvested with much effort without waste, and provide the people with well-processed grain, in particular.\nAs the construction of regional-industry factories is proceeding on a full scale across the country and the system of construction force, supply of materials and command have been established in relatively good order, it is the best choice in terms of time and profit to push ahead with the simultaneous construction of modern hospitals, sci-tech learning centers and grain management stations in every city and county on that occasion, he affirmed repeatedly, adding that when the regional development policy becomes a comprehensive one of covering public health, science and education, not confined to the construction of only light industry factories, it can make sincere and tangible contributions to the improvement of the material and cultural life of the regional people and drastically raise the efficiency of regional development.\nThere would be no remaining manpower as it would be too much to build all the new dwelling houses with the rural construction forces in cities and counties only, but if the vital undertakings are neglected, the efforts for regional development will end in vain, he stressed, adding our Party made a bold decision, reposing its trust in our army, the faithful defender, supporter and implementer of the Party policies, the pioneer of high civilization in the new era and the creator of people's happiness. He set forth detailed orientation for the army units mobilized for the construction of regional-industry factories to properly organize and allocate manpower and meticulously draw up the construction timetable to successfully carry out their new tasks.\nHe said that leading officials of relevant sectors would deeply study detailed plans and ways for implementing the bigger ten-year goal for regional development before discussing, examining, deciding and adopting them at a plenary meeting to be held in December, and successfully carry out them in yearly order.\nThe tasks are huge and the conditions are difficult, but if we work harder, we can surely realize our ideal, and it is the spirit peculiar to the Korean revolutionaries to assume heavy duties by themselves in hard times, he said, adding the regions and rural villages will get rid of their centuries-old backwardness literally and undergo complete transformation and the appearance of our state be changed beyond recognition 10 years later when the grandiose goals will be attained. Appealing for finding the worth of doing revolution and tiding over the current ordeals, picturing that day, he expressed his conviction that the grand projects, which will serve as a great stride in hastening the regional rejuvenation and transformation, will come to fruition without fail.\nHis field guidance at the construction sites of regional-industry factories will be etched in history as an important occasion, in which an important guideline and militant banner for enriching the Party's Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy and developing it onto a new high stage was brought about, and as another political event of epochal significance in the leadership activities of the WPK remaining boundlessly faithful to the original duty it assumed at the time of its foundation to reflect the people's desire and demands in its policies and fulfill them. -0-",

He said that practical measures will be taken to decisively increase the proportion of mechanization in regional construction.\nStressing the need to further encourage and expand the habit of evaluating the projects in strict conformity with the quality indices among the army units involved in the construction, construction control organs and other relevant sectors, he clarified the guidelines for thoroughly ensuring the quality of projects in keeping with the requirements of design and construction.\nHe expressed his view on the comprehensive principles to be maintained in designing industrial facilities, saying that the design sector should be developed faster than other sectors at a time when the scope of construction is steadily widened and the overall struggle for regional construction is being intensified in full swing.\nAfter looking round the construction sites, he had a talk with the leading officials accompanying him.\nSaying that success in implementing the Party's policies entirely depends on the leading officials, he pointed out a series of deviations that should be overcome without fail in the working method and style of the leading officials who should become an engine at every worksite of the revolution for comprehensive national rejuvenation.\nAnalyzing the practices revealed among officials who fail to give substantial and practical guidance from lack of detailed study into the present Party policies and the understanding of the Juche-based idea of architectural aesthetics and the importance and characteristics of the relevant construction projects and who are still not away from the sightseeing-style and stylish-manner guidance method of chanting groundless slogans which are not suited to the mind and age of the masses, he stressed that when they are well versed in the Party's policies and establish the initiative and active attitude and viewpoint in their implementation, even one field guidance can be a realistic and necessary one, a political guidance to the subordinates.\nHe also referred to the aimless competition which has not been eradicated in the construction field.\nNoting that when a competition is organized in the construction field, it should be a sure propellant to the cultural efflorescence of socialism, and the competition with the main stress on speed hindering the qualitative development of creation and construction has nothing to do with the mass movement of the present era of making a revolution, he said that the army units which assume the historic mission of the regional development should actively organize and conduct various functional competitions to radically improve skills of their officers and soldiers and beneficial and significant mass movements including training skilled workers, improving quality and arranging environment.\nSaying that the WPK has entrusted the huge and sacred historic process of bringing about regional changes by dint of self-reliance on the People\u2019s Army, believing in its loyalty and fighting efficiency, he clarified all tasks for giving full play to the might of the KPA in the honorable gigantic construction campaign.\nHe said that it is important for the KPA to conduct in a positive and fresh way the ideological education instilling into the service personnel the consciousness that they are the creator of material wealth for the people and pioneer of a new era of civilization in order to become a perfect vanguard in all aspects.

        "story_text":"Pyongyang, September 2 (KCNA) -- The noble sense of mission, far-reaching ideal and stubborn practical ability of the Workers' Party of Korea, which regards it as its main focus to originate everything in its revolutionary guidance to absolutely defending the people's rights and interests and steadily develop in depth the policy for their well-being, strongly promote the comprehensive prosperity and development of the DPRK, unfolding in succession the blueprints of transformation most desired and welcomed by the people.\nAt a time when the modern rural housing construction is going on in a massive way to remove the countryside's centuries-old backwardness on a nationwide scale and the ten-year revolution was launched in real earnest to rebuild the regional economy on a completely new and advanced basis, under the WPK's grand regional development strategy, the Party Central Committee made an another crucial decision and entered into the preparations for adopting an eventful policy decision on carrying out the historic task of successfully building advanced public health facilities, sci-tech dissemination centres and grain management facilities simultaneously in cities and counties across the country.\nGeneral SecretaryKim Jong Unon August 31 convened and guided a consultative meeting for regional development project as part of the preparations for adopting a new important decision to hasten the epochal development and comprehensive prosperity of regions as a Party policy.\nPresent at the meeting were Presidium members Kim Tok Hun and Jo Yong Won and relevant members of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee, chief secretaries of the provincial party committees, commanding officers of the services and corps of the Korean People's Army which dispatched their units to the regional construction in different areas, and officials in the field of design.\nDeeply analyzing the significance and importance of the construction of health facilities, sci-tech dissemination centers and grain management facilities in cities and counties that arise as a more essential requirement in accelerating the development of the Korean revolution and the historic cause of regional rejuvenation at present, the General Secretary said that to thoroughly implement the Party's regional development strategy is not merely a practical undertaking for building factories and structures but an important political work for giving full play to the advantages of our state system based on the people-first principle to implant the truth and invincibility of the socialist cause deep in the people and ensure the steady succession to the socialist cause.\nIn recent years the WPK set forth a policy on building light industry factories in local areas to develop cities and counties, regional bases, substantially, materially and in a planned way and has pushed ahead with its implementation in every way, but this alone is not enough to provide the regional people across the country with a sustained and improved material and cultural life, he said.\nThe newly-added three-point construction task is in full accord with the regional construction policy of the WPK and its policy of prioritizing science and technology and people-oriented policies and it is essential for implementing the programme of state construction to achieve the balanced and simultaneous development of the whole country and, accordingly, it is an urgent task to carry it into practice, he said. And he reaffirmed that now is the best time for the start of this important revolutionary work since KPA units have been deployed in every province, city and county and a national material supply and command system established in a well-regulated way to implement the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy.\nThe Party's policy for regional development in the new era should not be confined to the construction of light industry factories but should be a comprehensive policy dealing with public health, science and education, and only then, it can make a genuine contribution to the improvement of regional people's material and cultural life and radically improve the efficiency of regional development, he said, clarifying all the principles to be adhered to in building advanced city and county hospitals, scientific and technological dissemination bases and grain management facilities.\nHe said that it is his first cherished desire to build city and county hospitals which will greatly contribute to improving the regional health situation, relatively inferior, and promoting the life and security and health of local people, adding that it would be good to add the construction of modern health facilities to the Regional Development 20\u00d710 Policy and complete their construction in the set year without fail for the people in different local areas, though it is very difficult to do, and that this will be regarded as the first task the Korean revolution and the times entrust the Party and the government.\nScience and technology dissemination centers, too, should be completed in a big way wonderfully to provide the working people from all walks of life in local areas with enough conditions for contributing to the development of the state by dint of technology and knowledge and also comprehensive and integrated rice-processing facilities be built to further improve the people's diet, he stressed.\nHe said that it is important for the provincial, city and county Party committees and people's committees to find out their definite shares of work, including preparations for the operation of newly-to-be-built objects, and launch effective work for their realization, more deeply mindful that they are responsible for the implementation of the regional development policy.\nThe meeting, on the basis of in-depth study of the key issues guaranteeing the feasibility of the three-point construction essential for the regional development, discussed such detailed practical measures as the reinforcement of KPA units at all levels involved in the regional construction and the establishment of a central policy guidance system over the construction sector.\nNoting that these gigantic projects launched by the WPK are an important undertaking based on scientific calculation and it is the requirement of the Party Central Committee that they should be carried out on the highest level so that the local people can benefit from them even after 100 years,Kim Jong Unexpressed belief that the more our Party, government and army shoulder heavy burden, the faster the new era of regional transformation change will be brought and the further the welfare of people across the country will be promoted.\nSaying that great years are being witnessed when a grand cause of regional transformation, envisaged as an ideal for nearly 80 years, is realized during the ten-year revolution, he called upon all officials to conduct their work in a responsible manner with their strong will and firm confidence to surely bring about a new appearance in which the whole country has been changed and a radical turn has taken place in the life of the regional people as required by the Party's policy of regional development.\nHe said that the historic cause of regional development is a revolutionary undertaking to be proud of, though it needs much efforts and that when new edifices symbolic of the people's happiness and regional development have appeared in 20 cities and counties every year and the whole country is seething with the song of radical changes, we will feel more proud of the dynamic pace of today which we have taken with readiness for courageous struggle and fortitude.\nThe precious guidelines, which clearly stress our sacred and just cause of supporting the people as heaven and indicate the ways for comprehensively and rapidly developing the whole country as befitting the status and position of a powerful country while firmly maintaining the Korean-style view on development and mode of development, redoubled the noble sense of mission and spirit of exertion of all the participants in the meeting.\nThe new direction of struggle, which is of great significance in accelerating the historic cause of regional rejuvenation, is the responsible option and worthwhile revolutionary work of the WPK which regards it as its revolutionary climate and supreme desire to courageously shoulder all the burdens for realizing the people's cherished wishes and bringing about the future full of happiness.\nAll the participants raised their enthusiastic applause, extending the highest tribute toKim Jong Unwho is dynamically ushering in a new era of socialist civilization and prosperity while arousing all our servicepersons and civilians to the great struggle with his ardent spirit of serving the country and the people and sacred step of the most staunch and active exploration.\nThe consultative meeting, held under the guidance of the respected ComradeKim Jong Un, served as a political occasion of weighty significance in providing a practical guarantee for the expanded and deepened regional development policy of the WPK. The grand ideal and strong might of self-reliance of the WPK translating the people's dreams and wishes into brilliant reality are making a series of remarkable changes and eye-opening efflorescence in all aspects of socialist construction, looking forward to the rosy future. -0-",
